      "description": "This practicum-based class will be a partnership between Northwestern Medicine (NM) and Kellogg. This partnership is designed to educate students about the challenges of leading a large health system and its role in an ever-evolving healthcare ecosystem. In small teams, Kellogg students will work on NM key strategic initiatives in conjunction with NM administrative staff and leadership over the course of the Fall and Winter Quarters. This class is similar to a lab-class where most of the work in the class will be on your projects with some class time for didactic lectures and guest speakers. Class topics and speakers are designed to give students a view into running a large healthcare system. Potential class topics include Healthcare Financing, Healthcare Strategy, Healthcare Operations, Healthcare Innovation, and broad trends facing the healthcare ecosystem (such as alternative payment models, health equity, workforce recruitment and retention, consolidation). The class will be a total of 1 credit, taken over 2 quarters. You will enroll in 0.5 credits in the Fall over 10 weeks and 0.5 credits in the Winter Quarter over 10 weeks. Who should take the course? We hope that students interested in healthcare systems and the broader healthcare ecosystem enroll in this class, recognizing the outsized role that healthcare systems play. As the healthcare system evolves, a wide view of the value chain is critical to understanding how healthcare fits together as a cohesive business. This class aims to provide a unique opportunity to understand healthcare systems and the market no matter your future role in the ecosystem. This class will be application based and open to 1Y, MD/MBAs, JD/MBAs, and 2nd year 2Y students. E&W students who are interested can reach out Professor Paul Campbell and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. While there are no formal perquisites for the class, it is recommended that you have background in healthcare and understanding of the healthcare ecosystem and/or have taken Healthcare Economics STRT-444-0 or Healthcare Strategy STRT-443-0.

      "description": "As many products and services are becoming commoditized, brands are becoming increasingly important as key non-price differentiators. As a result, brands now have the potential to play an even greater role in creating value for customers as well as for the company. In this course, you will learn how to create and manage successful brands. We will discuss the key factors that enable brands to create value, focusing on the strategic aspects of building strong brands. You will learn about brand management in three different formats. First, you will learn from the lectures and the assigned course materials, which provide the background necessary to address the problems we will discuss in class. The second venue for learning is class discussions. Here you will have the opportunity to present your point of view and defend it against those of your classmates. Our goal for the class discussion is to come up with a viable solution for the branding problem faced by the company. Finally, the third learning venue is the individual case preparation and the case-related discussions within each team prior to discussing the case in class. The ultimate goal of this course is to enhance your knowledge of branding and brand management. Specifically, this course aims to: (1) introduce the key elements of brand management, (2) provide a sound framework for brand-focused action planning, and (3) sharpen your leadership, analytical, and communication skills. The course involves a mixture of case discussions and lectures, with an emphasis on developing a strategic approach that will enable you to understand the environment in which a company operates and identify opportunities and threats, identify and solve brand-related marketing problems, and develop actionable brand management plans.

      "description": "This course is a unique opportunity for students who are highly motivated and committed to their personal development and growth as a leader and who value the chance to do this work in a group setting. The Kellogg faculty leader serves as coach and facilitator to guide students through a process that explores who they are (strengths, needs, values), reveals how others experience them (feedback), examines who they want to be (vision/purpose) and identifies actions for moving forward (development planning). Individual reflective exercises will be further explored and shared in small group meetings, full class discussion, and individual coaching appointments with the faculty. Students complete a paper integrating their personal insights. There is no final exam. Because the course focuses on self-awareness and relationships with others, students rely on interactions with each other to experience vulnerability and growth within an environment of safety and trust. Therefore, students will not receive a letter grade, but rather a \"Pass\" with 0.5 credits or a \"No-Credit\" on their transcript. The \"Pass\" designation will be given if the following requirements are met: 100% attendance (non-negotiable), completion of all assignments, honoring confidentiality, and active participation in class activities and discussions. Please note that the 100% attendance policy is non-negotiable across all sections and instructors. Only bid on a section for which you are sure you can attend every class session.

      "department": "OPNS",
      "description": "The value of analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) in today's business landscape cannot be overstated. These tools have become integral to the decision-making process for many organizations across a variety of industries, including services, marketing, transportation, online platforms, and finance. AI systems often utilize a range of analytics techniques to make data-driven, evidence-based decisions. The analytics tools can be broadly classified to three types: Descriptive (What happened?): The interpretation of historical data to identify trends and patterns Predictive (What will happen?): The use of statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast future outcomes Prescriptive (What should be done?): The use of data-driven models to prescribe the best action plan. Prescriptive analytics, in particular, plays a key role in the functionality of AI systems. This type of analytics involves the use of data-driven models to determine the best course of action in a given situation, based on data and analysis of past outcomes and trends. By utilizing prescriptive analytics, organizations can make informed, strategic decisions that optimize outcomes and drive business success. For example, an AI system might use prescriptive analytics to determine the best way to match drivers with riders, recommend the best portfolio of stocks, or to recommend the most effective marketing campaign for a new product. By leveraging the power of advanced analytics techniques, organizations can gain a competitive edge and make more informed, strategic decisions that can drive growth and success. This course focuses on developing a holistic understanding of prescriptive analytics by introducing the basic principles and techniques of applied mathematical modeling for managerial decision-making. You will learn to use important analytic methods, such as spreadsheet modeling, optimization, and Monte Carlo simulation, to recognize their assumptions and limitations, and to employ them in decision-making. The emphasis will be on model formulation and interpretation of results, rather than on mathematical theory or coding. We will cover a wide range of prescriptive analytics models that are widely used in diverse industries and functional areas, including finance, operations, and marketing.

Pricing and promotion decisions are emphasized, with additional coverage on topics such as private labels, product assortment, trade funding, shopper marketing, and more. The course is organized around a hierarchy of topics. We spend roughly one week understanding pricing and promoting to an individual customer. This analysis provides the foundation as we move to more aggregate decisions, such as setting regular and promoted prices at the product level, managing category pricing, and understanding the drivers of store traffic. As we progress through this hierarchy of decisions, we illustrate how different types of data can---or can't---be used to answer managerial questions. A key part of the class is understanding the limitations of different types of data and how better planning can both simplify the analytics and increase your confidence in the findings. This class is very practical and hands-on. Most of the data we analyze is from real-world managerial problems, through collaborations with leading retailers and consulting firms who have brought problem-driven challenges to the classroom. Weekly homework assignments, both individual and group, are paired with in-class cases. There is no final exam.

      "department": "FINC",
      "description": "Finance II: Corporate Finance covers the financial knowledge you need to run a firm, whether the firm is a multi-billion international conglomerate or a three-person start up. You will learn how to answer the three fundamental question of corporate finance: (1) Capital structure or the funding decision: which source(s) of capital should you use to fund the firm's project? (2) Capital budgeting or the investment decision: which projects should you invest in? (3) Dividend decision: how should you deploy the capital that the project returns? We will cover the three fundamental methods for valuing projects and firms: discounted cash flow (or net present value), real options, and multiples analysis. The class begins with a theoretical framework. The world of finance is very complex. Without a logical structure that you can use to frame and answer questions, you will rapidly become lost and will be unable to defend your position. The theoretical framework is valuable, however, only if you can use it to examine real world decisions. Thus the majority of class time will be devoted to applying the logical framework. This course is important for anyone who plans to run a firm or a division, who hopes to be involved in the investment or funding decisions of the firm, who plans to work for a service provider who will assist the firm in analyzing these decisions (e.g., banking and consulting), or who plans to invest in firms or advise clients who will invest in firms. Even if you initially specialize in a different functional area, you want to understand how the finance function works. The most brilliant idea isn't useful if you cannot get it funded.

      "description": "In this course, literature serves as the entry point to analyze morally complex matters and then formulate and communicate cogent opinions about them in a group. Through literature, we will pull out common themes of classic moral quandaries that leaders face (e.g. pernicious issues such as greed or self-deceit, operating as an \"agent of another\" whom you disagree with, fractured professional and personal life, the troubles with \"likability,\" etc). We will then examine how characters in the stories and real-world business leaders have grappled with such issues and analyze how individuals make choices congruent with their values, what actions convey care for the systems within which they operate (or are responsible for), and perhaps most importantly, what can get them off track. Students will not only read critically and carefully, but will also learn the arts of listening well, facilitating dialog amidst disagreement, and articulating sound arguments through weekly reflection papers and their conversations with one another. The course is built around weekly small group discussions in class and a plenary lecture on the week's themes in the business world. The emphasis is on deep, rigorous reflection and meaningful communication rather than sound bites or quick tips. The reading materials span centuries, continents and viewpoints, building respect for the complexity of those we interact with on a daily basis. This discussion-based course includes weekly homework assignments (reading and writing), a group project analyzing a film that conveys moral complexity, and a final, individual paper and brief presentation on a work of your choosing.

Increased globalization and technological progress have further accelerated this process. Businesses are now held accountable by standards other than legal compliance or financial performance. Successful business leaders have recognized that these challenges are best mastered by a commitment to values-based management. However, simply \"doing the right thing\" is not enough. Rather, companies increasingly find themselves as targets of aggressive legal action, media coverage and social pressure. Organizations must be prepared to handle rapidly changing environments and anticipate potential threats. This requires a deep understanding of the strategic complexities in managing various stakeholders and constituencies.

We then define key operational metrics - flow time, throughput, inventory, cost and quality - and link them to financial measures of performance. Such a linkage allows a manager to identify operational metrics along which a process needs to excel or improve. We then discuss how various operational metrics can be tracked and measured. The rest of the course then focuses on identifying design and management levers that allow a manager to improve process performance along each of the key operational metrics.

      "department": "SSIM",
      "description": "This course is centrally concerned with to create companies that contribute to sustainability while generating economic value in competitive markets. It is based on three premises: First, that sustainability for most companies is no longer just a matter of compliance or social responsibility but is becoming a material imperative for the future viability of the business. This is because sustainability-related natural resource dynamics, regulatory changes, shifts in consumer and investor preferences, and technological innovation are driving disruptive change and transformations in many industries, including energy, mobility, real estate, food and financial services. The second premise is that 'real' sustainability is still difficult and that standard ways of approaching business decisions fall short on delivering effective solutions to issues like climate change or environmental justice. While win-win-win scenarios between economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social equity do exist, they are neither easy to recognize nor easy to execute, unless we integrate sustainability into management and decision processes. The third and last premise is that the key challenge for most companies is executing a strategy for changing their processes, products and business models while maintaining a high level of financial performance. For example, how should a CPG company achieve carbon neutrality targets and eliminate plastic waste? What are entrepreneurial opportunities in plant based meat substitution? How can an airline or property developer decarbonize their business? The course introduces a set of advanced practices and frameworks for holistically integrating sustainability into business decisions. This means on the one hand, learning the fundamental principles of sustainability and how they relate to economic value creation, identifying drivers and impediments for making sustainability material to value creation, and charting different pathways for effective sustainability transformations. It means on the other hand learning to use key tools for assessing in a systematic way the environmental and social impacts of existing business models. The course provides a thorough foundation for students that seek to specialize in sustainability in their work, and for students that need a holistic overview that allows them to integrate sustainability in a non-specialist role. The pedagogical format combines the introduction of conceptual frameworks, experiential exercises, case analyses and guest speakers.

While students will employ quantitative methods in the course, the goal is not to produce experts in statistics; rather, students will gain the competency to interact with and manage a marketing analytics and AI team. We will use the statistics program R in Customer Analytics and AI. R is harder to use that Stata but has become the industry standard (together with Python) and is extremely good for data management, visualization, and Machine Learning. Before you start the course, you will need to learn how to use R using tutorials and online course.

Please do not take this class if you are not willing or able to make this investment. The course consists of lectures, in-class exercises, group work, and case discussions.

The core question behind the course is this: How do entrepreneurial managers, family firms, closely held firms and those who finance them design and execute transactions that effectively match opportunities and resources in an international context? An overreaching insight of this course is that the notions of risk and reward are as important in privately-held as in publicly held firms. In privately-held firms and closely-held firms, however, entrepreneurs and financiers are often forced to make assumptions based on incomplete data. The course will provide you with the tools necessary to value companies domiciled in countries around the world. The aim of the course is for students to understand the motivations, decision processes, transaction execution, and valuation consequences of financial, business, and organizational restructuring done by buyouts, family firms and closely-held firms in an international context. The course facilitates developing the ability to plan, evaluate, and execute transactions using financial modeling and quantitative techniques. The course does not deal with venture capital, early-stage financing or entrepreneurship concepts. Topics Covered Include: - Valuing Cash Flows in an International Context: Cross-Border Valuation - Assessment of Country Risk and Expropriation Risk. Legal Issues - Capital Structure Decisions: Comparison of Different Sources of Capital - Impact of Funding Sources on Performance: Private Placements and Rule 144a - Private Equity Terms and Mechanics - Contracting Problems and Deal Structures.

The class teaches students tools and techniques to translate these problems into viable business concepts, with an emphasis on enabling an aspiring entrepreneur to get as far as possible, with as little as possible, as FAST as possible. Student teams begin the quarter with nothing more than a series of hypotheses about a new venture, then design and execute a series of in-market experiments that either validate these assumptions, or force them to iterate aspects of their business model in real time. The objective of the course to guide students toward the achievement of \"product-market fit\" as a crucial first step in in the creation of a startup. From here, students can evolve their businesses by enrolling in the \"Develop\" and \"Launch\" courses that serve as the continuation of the new ventures curriculum. New Venture Discovery course material ranges from customer discovery and design thinking, to rapid prototyping (of both offers and business models), bootstrapping methods and communicating/selling the vision for a new venture.

Taxes are also a crucial component of firm's investment and financing decisions. Unfortunately, knowledge of how taxes work is often left to the experts. This means that many opportunities for creating value for firms and investors are missed. This course will not make you a tax expert. You will still need to hire a tax expert. Instead the objective is to teach you enough of the structure of tax codes (past, current, and future; US and non-US) so that you can ask intelligent tax, business, and finance questions before it is too late. The class is designed to fill the gap between an MBA who is well trained in finance and the tax experts that you will rely on in your career. This is a rare and thus valuable position to be in. We will first develop a set of fundamental tax and finance concepts. We then will apply this to a wide range of investment, financing, and risk management applications. Derivatives is recommended but not required. I will have a tutorial/refresher for those who want it. Ask if you have questions. Course web site.

We will look at the trends in venture investment dollars and how the subsectors of digital health receiving those dollars has changed over time. 2021 was the biggest year yet for both digital health investment and M&A deals in healthcare. More than half of the digital health venture deals over the last five years have been early-stage companies. $36B of venture capital was invested in over 1100 early-stage digital health companies in 2021, up from only $4.5B and 332 companies in 2016. This is the first time ever that this exceeds venture investments in biopharma companies. The class will review customer needs (desirability), business models (viability), legal/regulatory requirements for digital health in the US and abroad (feasibility). Specifically, the course goals are to: Evaluate the early stages of company formation and how companies achieve product market fit, not growth and scale. Understand the evolution of digital health business models both in a company's growth and as markets change. Understand how legal and regulatory requirements shape digital health products and business models. Provide you with a framework to assess digital health opportunities. Introduce you to digital health entrepreneurs, investors and stakeholders who can provide perspective on early-stage companies and market opportunities. Apply your learnings to a real digital health company. It is recommended that students have taken one of the prerequisite courses or have work experience in health care. A deep knowledge of digital health is not required, but a basic understanding of healthcare is.

What role should corporate and financial actors play in safeguarding human health?

This course brings together students from the law, business, and medical schools to examine these questions, analyze human rights frameworks, and develop strategies for advancing the right to health through hands-on projects. Through a weekly seminar, students engage in theoretical and case-based discussions and participate in exercises and simulations to hone practical skills. Students then apply their interdisciplinary skills and expertise to projects in support of underserved communities or non-profit organizations seeking to promote the right to health in different countries around the world. This year, the course will include a particular focus on the intersection of human health and environmental justice, given that the triple planetary crises of climate change, toxic pollution, and ecosystem collapse are among the greatest threats to human health today. Students will analyze social determinants of health; impacts of inequality and racism on health outcomes; Indigenous and other non-western conceptions of health and human flourishing; and the relationship between the rights to health and to a healthy environment. Projects are expected to include collaborating with Indigenous partners in Panama to defend local communities' right to health, among other projects to advance human health and environmental justice.

      "description": "Healthcare services have long existed in a fee-for-service world where providers could maximize profits through the provision of a great quantity of services. Existing institutions blunted incentives to provide high quality care or care that resulted in a downstream reduction in the use of healthcare services. This world is changing - with many providers and payers moving towards a value-based regime where firms can earn profits when patients receive higher quality care thereby reducing downstream utilization, often of acute, specialty, and post-acute care. In response to this new reality there is a growing number of new entrants attempting to manage the care of enrollees in both public and private health insurance plans in a variety of value-based payment models. Additionally, many incumbent firms are modifying their strategies for this new paradigm. Success in a value-based world requires firms to develop and/or acquire new assets and implement new operating models. This course is a study of the systems necessary to succeed in this new world with a focus on the finance, strategy, marketing, and economics of care delivery in a value-based model. Our objective is to understand how the healthcare system is organized (or not) and managed (or not) so that we can create and capture value through the delivery of care. A large focus of the course will be about how smaller players and new entrants engage with the large and powerful incumbents that are central to the existing system.

This course is about learning the necessary entrepreneurial skills that will enable you create new markets that serve the remaining 93%, most of whom live in emerging economies. More specifically, this course has five goals. 1. To provide you with a lens that will help you see and assess the opportunities that exist in emerging economies. 2. To equip you with the relevant tools and frameworks to help you tackle the challenges unique to building a successful venture in emerging economies. 3. To walk you through the process, from start to finish, of developing an idea that can serve customers in emerging markets. 4. To introduce you to seasoned entrepreneurs, investors, and stakeholders in emerging market startup ecosystems who will provide feedback on your idea at the end of the class. 5. To practicalize your learning by having you work on a real market-creating project with real companies across emerging markets. This will help you develop your own entrepreneurial idea for emerging markets. In emerging markets, cost is often seen as the primary barrier preventing customers from purchasing (or consuming) a product. This course will introduce other barriers especially in the context of emerging markets and will also provide a framework for how students can design business models that take into consideration these additional barriers. From the first session to the last, the focus of this course will be on applying the skills, lessons, and frameworks you learn to develop market-creating ideas so that, at the end of the course, you have the confidence to present a viable business proposal to prospective investors.

Present day, our communications take many forms, and so we find ourselves in conversations, meetings, presentations, and even as producers on social media. As business leaders, we move through these many forms of communications in the course of a week, and indeed we can even traverse each of them within one day. In order to be dynamic, high-performing communicators, we must do three things: 1. Be cognizant of what high performance looks like in each of these distinct modes of communication; 2. Develop a situational awareness for how to succeed in each form; and 3. Become agile in calibrating our approach. Selling Yourself & Your Ideas is a course that will force you out of your comfort zone to help you show up, stand out, and break through. You will develop the knowledge, skills, and disciplines you need to be a powerful and influential communicator, no matter the situation in which you find yourself.

The Medical Technologies in Global Public Health course provides students the unique opportunity to inform the design and launch of medical technologies for developing countries by conducting market research. The students' findings will be shared with the developers of the medical technologies, including Northwestern University and several companies and philanthropists. Prior market research trips have taken place in India, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi and Zambia, each with a focus on medical technologies such as HIV tests, tuberculosis tests, and neonatal devices for small and sick newborns. This class typically requires a two week market research trip to an African country during Spring Break. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, a decision will be made in December on whether or not the course will be physically traveling to a country in Africa. The course will still take place even if the decisions is that it is not safe or reasonable to travel. Instead, students will be assigned to an Experiential Learning Project providing opportunity for virtual collaboration with partners across multiple African countries. This is the new normal for global health, at least for now. Students will spend the second five weeks of Winter Quarter in the classroom learning the science of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and other high-burden diseases; the background on medical technologies under development; and the essentials for conducting medical product market research in these geographies. Through interactive case studies and prominent guest lecturers, students will gain a holistic understanding and a broad overview of global health. During this time, students will also begin working with product developers from countries across Africa to better understand their products, needs and challenges. Following this initial coursework, students will spend the next five weeks during the Spring Quarter conducting user interviews both virtually and locally to understand how the medical technologies are perceived by key stakeholders in the market, including: end-users at hospitals and clinics, government officials, and NGOs and distributors. These results will then be analyzed to synthesize key findings and provide recommendations to the developers of these medical technologies. **Admittance to this course is by application only.** Your accepted application for this class will also ensure that you will be enrolled in SSIM-673-5 in Spring Quarter.

This course is focused on testing and validating product-market fit, user interfaces and experience and advancing to the development of a refined MVP concept. There is an emphasis on using digital tools to test customer acquisition and messaging. Teams are not expected to have programmers at this point in time as the focus is on using a variety of free ware to test the product/service. A significant portion of the workload for this course will occur outside of the classroom. Students must be prepared to engage with potential customers and industry experts. Within the classroom, students will be encouraged to share learning experiences and help other student teams. The course work will be supplemented by guest speakers who are experts in specific industries as well as functional areas and a pool of alumni and local mentors who can assist in the development of their businesses. New Venture Development will be offered in the winter and spring quarters. Upon the completion of New Venture Development, student teams and faculty will determine whether a team should move to New Venture Launch. Other courses that are beneficial to take in advance of this course are: MKTG 961: Entrepreneurial Tools for Digital Marketing and MORS 952: Building Innovation, Teams, and Cultures. Admittance to New Venture Development is by application only. The application is available here.

A common theme is that the success or failure of a strategy often depends on how your competitors will respond. As a result, what may be a winning strategy for a monopolist can sometimes backfire in an oligopoly. The course will mix lectures and case studies, as well as both qualitative and quantitative components.

As potential scientific innovations move through the research and development process, the various firms require both the involvement of increasingly sophisticated managers and infusions of additional capital from the private and the public market. This can often involve acquisitions or licensing with existing players - many of which have effectively outsourced large portions of drug discovery to these early stage firms. As a result, determining how value is created and captured in this area requires understanding the incentives and motivations of all of the players in the system, including but not limited to small biotechs, large pharmaceutical firms, venture capitalists, pubic investors, and private equity firms. This is true whether one is interested in operating an early stage firm, undertaking business development activities at larger firms, or being an investor in the public or private market. This course combines elements of your previous strategy, finance, and healthcare curriculum with new concepts and techniques specific to biopharmaceutical that will allow you to better understand this market. Students will apply tools of valuation and strategic decision making to both large and small firms that are attempting to develop and market new biopharmaceutical innovations. This will include both individual and group coursework requiring the use of concepts from previous finance, strategy, and economics courses - where groups will include a mixture of students with more and less backgrounds in each of these areas.
