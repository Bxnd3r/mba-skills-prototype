      "description": "This course provides you with a basic understanding of the construction and interpretation of corporate financial reports which are used by external parties (including investors, creditors, and regulators). Our goal is to help you become informed user of financial statement information. Fulfillment of these objectives involves acquiring several skills: (i) gaining familiarity with business transactions; (ii) understanding how those transactions map into accounting numbers; (iii) developing fluency in accounting terminology; and (iv) appreciating the complexity of accounting due to the (considerable) discretion and judgment involved in implementing accounting rules. The course emphasizes the use of real financial statements, so that you become accustomed to the many variations that these reports take. This course is for MMS: Foundations of Business students."

The volume, variety, and velocity associated with currently available data motivate an important paradigm for data-driven decision-making in business. Beyond extracting information from data, and creating data-driven, real-time autonomous decision making systems, the data itself should be thought of as an asset for current and future use. In this course, we will study the core ideas behind data mining, challenges associated with big data, and the interplay between data science and business decisions. We will focus on (1) general principles that are long lasting despite the rapidly changing technology; (2) specific algorithms/technologies that are currently being used in many industries; and (3) 'hands-on' analyses of actual datasets to develop methodologies. Ultimately, the course aims to develop 'data-analytic' thinking. This should enable you to evaluate how data can improve performance, identify opportunities, and assist in decision making for managers. The understanding of the principles of data mining techniques will allow you to interact effectively with experts/consultants, and to quickly conduct pilot studies.

This reduces transaction costs and lowers the possibility of fraud. The work for the course consists primarily of readings and an entrepreneurial group project that is presented at the end of the course.

      "department": "General Elective",
      "description": "This course employs a number of overlapping frameworks. Foremost among these is the concept of the customer lifecycle. This concept decomposes customer interactions into birth, growth and death. Birth involves customer acquisition or first sale. Growth involves customers buying more items and spending more on these items (denoted cross-selling and upselling). Death involves leaving the firm, typically called attrition or churn. Collectively, the stages of the customer lifecycle imply a revenue and profit stream that can be managed. The financial discounting of this profit stream yields the net present value of a customer, often called customer lifetime value, or CLV for short. Summing CLV across customers \u2014 or customer equity \u2014 is a major component of the value of the firm, net of investments. This course will develop quantitative methods to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of customer relationship management (CRM) activities.

We will identify and empirically analyze a variety of market structures, ranging from perfect competition to oligopoly (rivalry between a small number of competitors) to monopoly (one dominant firm). We want to develop the skills necessary to make effective managerial decisions and strategic choices based on the quantitative analysis of a firm's productive capabilities and the market in which it operates. We will also focus strongly on the insight necessary to optimally identify, estimate, interpret, and test an economic model. This course is designed for students who are interested in utilizing empirical economic models for market analysis.

In the second module, called Supply Chain Analytics, the focus will broaden from a single process to the entire supply chain. Students will learn to forecast uncertain demand, optimize inventory, and design distribution networks and supply chains to match supply with demand. The course is designed for students who are interested in operational and consulting positions, who may interact with operations units of a firm (e.g., product or marketing managers), and who need to understand supply chain strategies at a high level.

We also introduce a framework that structures the most important operational decisions into three categories, and discuss how to make decisions in these categories that align each dimension of operational performance with the firm's strategic goals. Finally, we apply this framework to analyze a series of critical problems faced by modern firms, such as developing resilient operations strategies, integrating social and environmental responsibility into operations strategy, scaling operations strategies in start-ups, and integrating breakthrough technology into an operations strategy.
