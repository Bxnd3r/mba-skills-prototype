      "department": "General Elective",
      "description": "The course objective is to learn a conceptual framework for analyzing and shaping negotiation processes and outcomes. Negotiation can be broken down into two basic activities: creating value and capturing value. Creating value is about making the pie bigger, while capturing value is about getting the largest possible slice for yourself. The course presents strategies for achieving both of these objectives at the same time. The course also helps students to develop a repertoire of negotiation strategies and skills. There are several opportunities to negotiate with classmates in a simulated environment."

      "description": "Costa Rica is a unique country in many respects. It is one of the few countries in the world without an army and is characterized by table political climate and high economic development. For instance, it has the highest public healthcare development in Latin America, with general insurance which covers 100% of the country and public universal education, which led to a life expectancy at birth of 80 years and a literacy rate of 96%. Further, for several years now, Costa Rica has run entirely on renewable energy and is the most diverse place in the world per square kilometer. This is also one of the few nations where 25% of the total territory is protected, and it hosts 5% of the world\u2019s biodiversity. The course begins with three sessions of classroom study and culminates with a 10-day trip to Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, we will visit companies and meet business and political leaders, with an emphasis on the central role that foreign direct investment has had in the country\u2019s growth. We will learn about coffee production and its central role in the country\u2019s historical development. We will also visit natural reserves and animal sanctuaries in the country, which relies on tourism as its main source of hard currency and learn about their funding structure."

How has the development of India\u2019s financial sector shaped access to capital for conglomerates, high-tech entrepreneurs, rural small businesses, and everything in between? How is India\u2019s business environment shaped by its legal, political, and cultural environment, and what might not be immediately apparent from an outsider\u2019s perspective?"

This model, which prioritizes long-term value creation for a broad range of stakeholders beyond shareholders, will be juxtaposed with Japan's recent shift toward a more shareholder-centric economy. The course will also explore key challenges facing the country, including addressing the super-aging society, advancing gender equality, promoting diversity and inclusion, and incorporating youth perspectives within the context of a silver democracy. The course will be of particular benefit to students interested in the relationship between business practices and societal impact. Beyond exploring Japan's stakeholder-oriented capitalism and economic landscape, the trip will also encompass cultural activities and sightseeing, providing a comprehensive experience in one of the world's most dynamic economies."

At the same time, it is a country situated in the most heavily-armed region of the world where conflicting interests of China, Russia, Japan, and the US have collided and shaped its politics and economy. It is also a country that underwent extremely rapid ascent into the world\u2019s top-tier economy which, while benefitting the population as a whole, created societal tensions and related challenges. Through business meetings and other activities, in this IE trip you will have a chance to learn about many different aspects of Korean economy and culture as well as current challenges in the business environment, and get a better understanding of Korea\u2019s role in the fast-changing international dynamics marked by structural shifts and uncertainties."

Among the issues we will discuss are its tax laws, and why they have led companies to move substantial parts of their operations to Ireland. Through lectures, including some from members of the faculty at the University College Dublin, we will explore some of the political changes that led to the tax and regulatory changes. We will also look into the types of companies that moved their operations to Ireland. Plus, we will look at why Irish firms dominate the airline leasing industry. Once in Ireland we will visit some of the companies covered in the lectures. They will provide insights into what their Irish operations look like and how they interact with parts of the company located elsewhere around the globe. Since St. Patrick\u2019s Day falls in the middle of the trip, we will of course visit any number of cultural sites and offer people the opportunity to partake in the celebrations."

      "department": "General Elective",
      "description": "International and Experience. The first word means that we are going abroad\u2014for this section to Norway. The second word is a bit vague. In designing the course, we took it literally\u2014you\u2019re going to do things\u2014in addition to hearing about them. Part of the goal of such a course is to be an example of what working in a different country would be like\u2014and how to prepare for it. How work itself is carried out in Norway does not differ much from the US. Startup incubators often are funky open spaces with a fussball table close to the entrance. Factory assembly lines in Norway looks like ... assembly lines. And negotiations are mostly structured similarly to what you would experience in the US. But behind the more technical aspects some things are different, such as trust, transparency and social equality. And understanding these are important for doing work in Norway. This trip will focus on such differences, and with this in mind we are working on the potential visits below (nothing is confirmed at this point so there will be lots of changes). What this course will be like? When putting together a program to better understand Norway, it became natural to focus on various not-for-profit organizations. To provide an experience, it seems hard to do so without making you work\u2014so this will not be a \u201cvacation for credit\u201d. For several of the visits, we will combine a more traditional approach\u2014the host presenting to you, with a reverse approach\u2014you presenting to the host. There will also be a strict no-device policy (except when part of the program) for all visits and pre-trip sessions. Potential visits that we are working on (some will not work out, more will be added):Nobel peace prize, Tyrili \u2013 a non-for-profit drug rehab organization. We will probably stay overnight at their location in Mesnali, which is a shared mountain facility among their locations where patients live full-time, Sovereign Wealth Fund. We hope to set up a visit there with focus on ESG (environment, sustainability, and governance). Prison system. Balancing punishment and rehabilitation, Ministry of foreign affairs, The Viking economy. We are also looking into potential activities. One may be if we can go out in a Viking ship replica, which will require rowing and other forms of physical activity (one uncertainty is if the inner parts of the Oslo fjord is still frozen over). Another potential activity would be to try skiing (if we do this, it will be a choice between cross country, and for those who have experience, alpine skiing)."

Long recognized as the birthplace of transformative technologies and business models, Silicon Valley provides a living laboratory for understanding how ideas, talent, and capital converge to drive global change. Priority will be given to students who are nonUS citizens. During the trip, students will visit leading technology companies, early-stage startups, venture capital firms, and university innovation labs. These visits will illuminate the region\u2019s distinctive culture of experimentation and collaboration, as well as its evolving role in shaping the future of industries such as artificial intelligence, clean energy, and digital finance. In addition to business meetings, students will engage with entrepreneurs, investors, and Yale alumni to discuss current opportunities and challenges in the innovation economy. Cultural and community activities across the Bay Area will complement these experiences, offering a deeper appreciation of the region\u2019s diversity, creativity, and enduring spirit of possibility. Priority will be given to MBA students who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents, as only non-U.S. citizens may receive Global Studies (GSR) credit."

At its heart, this course is about using quantitative models to provide managerial insights. The framework for this course is simple: First, we focus on how work is organized and how processes are improved. At the next higher level, we consider the relationship among work centers, suppliers, and customers: the design and improvement of the supply chain. Finally, operations analysis influences and is influenced by the organization\u2019s competitive strategy. While carrying out these activities, organizations need to continually improve manufacturing and service quality. These activities of process improvement, supply chain management, and quality management fundamentally involve issues of workforce management and organizational behavior and require understanding and applying capital budgeting and other accounting/finance tools, and coordination with the marketing function."

GSE has worked with more than 50 leading and emerging Indian social enterprises engaged in economic development, sustainable energy, women\u2019s empowerment, education, environmental conservation, and affordable housing. The course covers both theoretical and practical issues, including case studies and discussions on social enterprise, developing a theory of change and related social metrics, financing social businesses, the role of civil society in India, framing a consulting engagement, managing team dynamics, etc. The course will be taught by Asha Ghosh, Lecturer at SOM. The course meets on Wednesday afternoons 2:40 \u2013 5:40 during Fall-2 and Spring-1. Students will travel to India to work on-site with their partner SEs, and for a convening of all the student/SE project teams, in mid- to late January 2026 for 10 days. As with the International Experience and the Global Network Immersion Week, students will be responsible for covering the costs of their round-trip airfare to India and related expenses (such as visa and immunizations). SOM students can draw on their available GSA days to offset in-country travel, hotel, and related costs. GSE has arrangements with Jackson and YSE to cover in-country costs for their students. Enrollment is by application only. Students accepted and enrolled in GSE will allocate 150 of their fall course bidding points towards the course. This is considered a 6 unit course that spans fall-2 and spring-1. It may not be taken as a half semester course. 2 units are applied in fall-2 and 4 units applied in spring-1. If travel to India is cancelled the units will change from 4 to 2 in spring 2026."

The digital economy has grown rapidly since the first wave in the 1990s when the internet opened new opportunities to provide information, services, and to buy physical goods - many failed (e.g., eToys, B2B marketplaces) or faded over time (e.g., Excite), but they proved digital could work and several thrived (e.g., Amazon, Google, Expedia). Post the early 2000s bubble, we saw a second wave of digital disruption where a few specific verticals (e.g., news, media, retail, travel) saw major transformations led by a second wave of \u201cBorn of the Web\u201d companies (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Etsy, AirBnB, Uber). The 2010s saw digital accelerate and expand beyond the first impacted industries into food (curbside pick up / delivery vs. eating out and/or going to grocery store), entertainment (streaming vs. TV/movies, highlights vs. watching live sports), auto (online purchase vs. dealers), and branded apparel (Direct to Consumer vs. physical retail). The 2020s have accelerated these trends and added new B2C industries (e.g., electric and autonomous vehicles, cryptocurrency, online gambling) and the development of B2B2C industries (e.g., embedded insurance, marketplaces). This class will focus (1) identifying technology changes that can create windows for disruption, (2) determining how to pick which opportunities to pursue and (3) how new entrants and incumbents drive to win in these new spaces."

The class will explore how AI-driven aesthetics, brand trust, and cultural intelligence can define the global expansion strategy of an Asian-based art-tech brand entering the U.S. market. Rather than treating AI as a technical layer, it will examine it as a new design and business language - one that connects art, data, and commerce into a coherent cultural experience. The case study work will be augmented with readings, presentations, and visiting lecturers. Please note this is a highly creative process that, in addition to research, involves extensive qualitative, intuitive, rhetorical, visual, and written work.

These challenges are especially pronounced in global virtual teams (GVTs), where cultural differences, time zone variations, and other issues can hinder team effectiveness. This course builds on foundational principles of managing organizations, groups, and teams through an action-learning approach, allowing you to apply knowledge and skills in practice. You\u2019ll participate in exercises that simulate the issues faced by GVTs, focusing sometimes on the \u201cglobal\u201d aspect, sometimes on the \u201cvirtual,\u201d and often both. The course is structured into three modules: \u2022 MODULE 1 | GVT Class Sessions (5 Sessions) | 16:10-18:10, Tuesdays and Thursdays; January 20, 22, 27, 29, and February 3 | These exercise and simulation-based sessions build on concepts and frameworks introduced earlier in the curriculum, aiming to deepen your knowledge in building, managing, and leading effective teams in global and virtual settings. \u2022 MODULE 2 | GVT Negotiation Exercise | January 29 \u2013 February 27, 2026 | Jointly conducted with 10+ GNAM partner schools, this module places you in a GVT with students from different schools around the world. You\u2019ll complete an interactive learning exercise involving team-building, coordination, decision-making, and cross-team analysis. This assignment provides real-time, hands-on practice implementing lessons from Module 1. \u2022 MODULE 3 | GVT Debrief Workshop | 16:10-18:10, Tuesday, March 3, 2026 | We will reconvene for a final session to share your experiences and insights from the GVT Negotiation Exercise."

      "description": "Trust in science among the public is at a recent-historic low, and there are powerful forces working to keep it that way. If experts do not actively engage in the information landscape, their work risks being undone or lost. If they interact in the wrong ways, they could end up only contributing more to the chaos and division that currently characterize the information landscape. Opting out is not an option; we all have public faces now, and the question is how best to develop and utilize them. Given the state of division and distrust that threaten science, it should likely be among the aspirations of every graduate with an interest in healthcare management, science, medicine, and/or public health to have some part in shaping narratives that promote health and fact-based discourse over angry, divisive stagnation. This course invites students to study ways in which it can be done, and to reflect on their own potential, and to try out different techniques and different platforms\u2014to begin to find their public voice. To see what works for some messages and some communicators, and what fails, and why. The course will introduce and study the increasingly broad array of tools to engage in public discourse, to reach people outside of their immediate circles of professional contacts, and to influence the lives of many. It is predicated on the idea that science cannot be conceived as a system by which knowledge emanates outward (much less downward) from academia, or it will cease to reach people and to affect the world, but only exacerbate distrust and claims of elitism. Rather science can only exist as an active process of communication between researchers and the public. This is how trust is built and the learning process is most effective, as a mutual, shared endeavor. This is a widely held conception of science, and yet the actual methods of such engagement are overlooked or ignored by many in the health sciences. This course is not prescriptive, but is meant to engage critically with modes of communication and shaping discourse. The course will equip students to critically analyze emerging methods of health-oriented communication. It will offer a survey of many approaches wherein students will develop an understanding of the canonical paths to writing for large audiences (op-eds, long-form journalism)\u2014as well as explore how narratives emerge over time in much smaller and more personal scales. We will study the role that experts play in creating media on their own platforms and by working with media outlets as either sources or contributors, consultants or editors or publishers. It is critical that not all experts communicate in the same styles and on the same platforms. Writing an op-ed in The New York Times is valuable, for example, but the ability to do that is just one tool in what needs to be an arsenal of ways of reaching people across cultural, socioeconomic, ideological, intellectual, and educational backgrounds.\""

Moreover, instilling an experimental \u201cculture\u201d promotes humility (because experimental results pose a perpetual and imminent threat to those who most stridently voice their current opinions and positions) and \u201cflattens\u201d organizational hierarchies (because the ability to generate novel manipulations or make correct predictions can rival seniority or occupational rank as a source of prestige and power). On a more personal level, learning how to \u201cthink like a scientist\u201d should help demystify scientific jargon and give you the confidence to seriously scrutinize scientific (and pseudoscientific) claims, many of which are utter nonsense."

Repeatedly policymakers and media have lamented that the government could have done a better job communicating during the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 (GFC). However, the traditional literature of crisis communication says little about preparing for or managing a financial crisis. In this course you will learn the basic theories of crisis communications and the various communication frameworks and techniques used to respond to crises. With this knowledge, we will then look closely at communications during industry crises and then financial emergencies and crises (and in particular the GFC) to discern what are appropriate communications frameworks for preparing for and addressing a systemic financial crisis.\""

We will then progress through more modern developments from computer science on preference aggregation and fair allocation, including applications to AI and online platforms. The final part of the course will focus on institutions for distributing voting power. This includes traditional systems like apportionment and redistricting, as well as more radical proposals like liquid democracy and citizens assemblies. Throughout, particular focus will be given to designing efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees. This is a research-focused course geared toward PhD students in Operations, Computer Science, Economics, and related fields. Advanced undergraduates may enroll by instructor permission only, and will be held to the same standard as graduate students. The only firm prerequisite is that you must be very comfortable reading and writing mathematical proofs, specifically in areas of discrete mathematics. The course will also assume understanding of basic concepts in game theory (mixed strategies, Nash equilibria) and CS/OR (linear programming, NP-completeness).

The subject matter will embrace and integrate such broad key dimensions of strategic change as economic context, shifting markets, emerging technologies, corporate life stage, company culture, and corporate governance together with the character, skill-set, and life stages of individual leaders. The course mission involves three equally important goals. The first is to help students anticipate the multi-dimensional cross-disciplinary aspects of successful planned change from strategic systems to group dynamics and individual psychology. A second is to appreciate the consequences of the unintended effects of strategic change initiatives on work communities and societies at-large. The last is to provide students with an overview of the contemporary industry-specific challenges in an effort to highlight the varied leadership values and skills that are not always apparent as corporations make acquisitions or managers select careers. The course materials used to fulfill this mission require students to be comfortable with a wide variety of learning tools including: research articles; case studies; current industry periodicals; spirited class discussion; role playing; video; and frequent prominent industry leaders as class visitors. Following an overview that builds an analytic framework for the course, the key dimensions of strategic change will be examined through a sequence of industry-by-industry settings including: professional services; financial services; retail; e-commerce; communications and media; recreation and travel; government and nonprofit; industrial and consumer products. Toward the close, the course will return to cross-industry change leadership and challenges such as executive succession, life stage imperatives, and ethical dilemmas.

      "department": "General Elective",
      "description": "The class meets on Thursdays, 1:00 - 4:00 p.m. beginning on January 22, 2026. This course is open to all Yale graduate students as well as Yale College seniors. In order to enroll in this course you must attend the first class meeting on January 22 in its entirety. Also, please note that there is a homework assignment due before the first class. Auditing is not permitted. Course description: This course will be co-taught by Jeffrey E. Garten and Robert D. Hormats, whose combined experience spans the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and Obama administrations, as well as decades on Wall Street. The course is based on the premise that America\u2019s role and policies in the global economy are undergoing a profound change that will outlast the current administration in Washington. It will examine the major forces in the U.S. and abroad that will be determining America\u2019s future in the global economy and the likely policies it will follow for the next decade. These will include changes in the country\u2019s industrial and financial structures, new social pressures, new demographic patterns, and evolving political alignments. Typical of the kinds of questions to be examined will be: How will the changing labor force affect America\u2019s interest in the global arena? How will changing technology affect these interests? What about changes in energy and the environment? What will trade policy, policy toward foreign investment and immigration policy look like? How should we think about the changing roles of Wall Street, Corporate America, and Silicon Valley? Regarding developments abroad, we will ask questions such as these: How will China\u2019s evolving interests, or new directions for the European Union, or the changing position of big emerging markets, or new pressures in global finance influence American policy, and with what effect? If the U.S. attempts to reduce its international involvement, who will write and try to enforce the \u201crules of the game?\u201d Given the centrality of the United States to the global economy, the course will be important global background for future leaders in any profession.

The course aimes at helping students look at the entire marketing mix in light of the strategy of the firm. The course builds on the foundation developed in core courses, and the basic framework rests on the recent development in economics and strategy \u2013 resource based view (RBV) of strategy. You will have a chance to illustrate your ability to apply this framework in this course through case discussion and an in-class final exam. It will be most helpful to students pursuing careers in which they need to look at the firm as a whole. Examples include consultants, investment analysts, entrepreneurs, and product managers. Case studies will highlight marketing strategy exercise in consumer packaged goods, high tech, pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods."

      "description": "Please note that to enroll in the course, you must attend the first class meeting. Additionally, please note that there will be an assignment due prior to the first class. Auditing is not permitted. Course description: Finance can be likened to the circulatory system of the global economy, and we will focus on the past, present and future of that system. The course is designed to deal with questions such as these: What is the global financial system and how does it work? What are the pressures on that system including market, regulatory, political and social dynamics? What are the key challenges to that system? How can the system be strengthened? In this course we are defining the global financial system (GFS) as encompassing central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions such as asset managers and private equity firms, financial regulators and international organizations. Thus, we will encompass subjects such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Carlyle Group and the BlackRock Investment Management Co., the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We will take a broad view of the GFS including its history, its geopolitical framework, its economic foundations and its legal underpinnings. We will consider the GFS as a critical public good in the same way that clean air is a public good. We will look at a number of other key issues such as how the GFS deals with economic growth, economic and financial stability, distributional questions, employment issues, and long-term investments in infrastructure. We will discuss how new technologies are affecting several of the biggest issues in global finance. We will examine the GFS as a large-scale complex network, thereby compelling us to see it in an interconnected and multidisciplinary way. The emphasis will be on the practice of global finance more than the theory."

Policy modeling is most useful when the amounts of data, money, time, and other resources one would like for purely scientific investigation are highly constrained by the decision-making environment.

Building on earlier coursework in probability modeling, decision analysis and economics, the techniques introduced include \"back of the envelope\" probabilistic models such as Bernoulli, Poisson, Markov and elementary renewal processes, hazard functions, queueing theory, and epidemic modeling. Simple cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness approaches are integrated with the above. The course will feature applications to problems drawn from public health, criminal justice, public housing, and counterterrorism.

There will be weekly problem sets which must be submitted on-time to receive credit, and a take-home exam scheduled for the latter part of the semester. Prerequisite: Students must have completed MGT 403 (Probability Modeling and Statistics) or equivalent to take this class. The probability modeling knowledge required is covered in any introductory probability course and includes: sample space, event probabilities including marginal, joint and conditional, Bayes' Rule, random variables, probability distributions, expected value, mean, variance, Bernoulli, binomial, uniform, and normal random variables, joint distributions, independence, covariance and correlation, sums of random variables (both independent and dependent), central limit theorem, and sampling distributions.

      "department": "General Elective",
      "description": "The collapse of the USSR and its satellites recast business-government relations across the former communist world. New markets developed, state assets were privatized, and novel business ventures proliferated. Even China, which retained its Communist political system, joined the capitalist economic order with a vengeance at home and abroad. The end of the Cold War also reshaped business-government relations in the West, as the threatening shadow of an alternative to capitalism \u201cout there\u201d vanished. This course explores the business-government nexus in this evolving context. The goal is to rethink business\u2019s place in society, and its relations with government, in an era when alternatives to capitalism are moribund. The motivating thought is that unless business is part of the solution to major social and political challenges \u2013 from sustaining democracy to feeding populations to managing health and environmental threats \u2013 it will likely be part of the problem. We examine cases in which new business roles have been more and less successful to chart the emerging landscape and develop accounts of best practices and pitfalls to avoid. As well as the older capitalist democracies, we will study Russia, China, India, Vietnam, Cuba, South Africa, Israel, Palestine, and the Gulf states in the Middle East."

We also focus heavily on extrapreneurship, which is the idea of innovating across the boundaries of multiple institutions. The course is centered on health equity, which means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires addressing obstacles to health such as poverty, racism, gender and other biases and their consequences; including disparities in power, livelihood, education, housing, food, safety, and health care services. We refer to these as drivers of health. Across careers and professions, our work influences and is influenced by one or more drivers of health. In this case-based course, we examine a wide spectrum of public health entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship (PHEI) cases ranging from collective action in a non-profit setting to digital start-ups in a venture-backed setting. This course brings together students from the Schools of Management, Public Health, Environment, Global Affairs, Divinity, Engineering, Arts and Sciences, and undergraduates.

After successful completion of \u201cStrategic Market Management,\u201d you will be able to 1) conduct data analysis techniques such as Hypothesis testing, A/B testing (which is frequently used to test website designs, products, email marketing, \u2026), Logistic regression and discriminant analysis (which is frequently used for one-to-one marketing, targeting, \u2026), Cluster Analysis (which is frequently used for market segmentation, determination of the competitive set, \u2026), Factor analysis, perceptual maps (which is used for positioning of a brand, dealing with multi-collinearity in regressions, \u2026), Conjoint analysis (which is frequently used for new product development and market simulations). 2)choose and apply the correct tool to implement marketing strategies. 3)evaluate how a specific data analysis tool can inform your marketing strategies and understand the limitations of each statistical analysis. We will first practice each concept using simple, small data sets for educational purposes and then apply them to \"real\" data that I am collecting from a pre-course student survey. The group projects, the final assessment of your learning in this course, will consist of an application to company data.\""

      "description": "This half semester course will provide an introduction to real estate development, investment, finance and strategy outside of the United States. Global investment in financial assets, the need for risk diversification, the increased accuracy of property records, greater transparency, more relaxed laws permitting foreign investment, and population movement around the world\u2014all of these trends have led to a tremendous increase in cross-border real estate investing for both private equity and public companies. While many studies of international real estate focus on the role of foreign real property in the U. S. institutional portfolio, this course will take a wider and more historical view of the cultural attitudes towards real estate around the world and how they impact the quality and risk of investment assets. Detailed analysis will begin with property level due diligence in order to provide a fundamental understanding of how and why property markets differ by country beyond simple supply/demand dynamics. This course will consist of three parts: a.) a micro-market analysis of real property characteristics in various countries around the world, including financing, leasing and valuation; b.) an analysis of investment vehicles\u2014public and private\u2014available to institutional investors, as well as cross-border transactions, and c.) a macro-market view of world space and capital markets, the rationale for international investing, trends in capital flows and portfolio composition and the various ways in which risk is measured and mitigated. Each part of the course will require a brief individual assignment completed over a two-week period. The first research project will be a study of a significant real property asset outside of the United States, including its market, ownership, legal structure, valuation, and transaction history. Both the G-8 and G-20 nations will be the object of study, but individual students are free to concentrate on any country of interest. The second research project will consist of an analysis of a private equity or publicly-traded foreign property company, its current fair value, competitive advantage and future prospects. An interview with a top executive of a company will be encouraged and facilitated. The third research project will consist of a comparative analysis of world property markets and the hypothetical investment in a portfolio of real estate assets across three or more foreign property markets. The course will consist of lectures, discussion, case studies and readings on international real estate from a variety of sources. No final exam or group project will be required."

Although central banks around the world are broadly similar in terms of their mandates and policy instruments, emerging market central banks are different by way of the policy trade-offs they face, the degrees of freedom available to them and the environment in which they operate. As the global economic center of gravity shifts towards the emerging world, an intelligent appreciation of emerging economy perspectives is imperative for acquiring a broad-based worldview of the global economy. In that light, the course will focus on the challenges and dilemmas of central banking in emerging markets. Drawing from international, particularly emerging market experience of the last two decades, the course will prioritize practice over theory and breadth over depth. Although no quantitative models will be used, an understanding of the concepts of macroeconomics is a prerequisite."

GSE has worked with more than 50 leading and emerging Indian social enterprises engaged in economic development, sustainable energy, women\u2019s empowerment, education, environmental conservation, and affordable housing. The course covers both theoretical and practical issues, including case studies and discussions on social enterprise, developing a theory of change and related social metrics, financing social businesses, the role of civil society in India, framing a consulting engagement, managing team dynamics, etc. The course will be taught by Asha Ghosh, Lecturer at SOM. The course meets on Wednesday afternoons 2:40 \u2013 5:40 during Fall-2 and Spring-1. Students will travel to India to work on-site with their partner SEs, and for a convening of all the student/SE project teams, in mid- to late January 2026 for 10 days. As with the International Experience and the Global Network Immersion Week, students will be responsible for covering the costs of their round-trip airfare to India and related expenses (such as visa and immunizations). SOM students can draw on their available GSA days to offset in-country travel, hotel, and related costs. GSE has arrangements with Jackson and YSE to cover in-country costs for their students. Enrollment is by application only. Students accepted and enrolled in GSE will allocate 150 of their fall course bidding points towards the course. This is considered a 6 unit course that spans fall-2 and spring-1. It may not be taken as a half semester course. 2 units are applied in fall-2 and 4 units applied in spring-1. If travel to India is cancelled the units will change from 4 to 2 in spring 2026."

Auditing is not permitted. Course description: Finance can be likened to the circulatory system of the global economy, and we will focus on the past, present and future of that system. The course is designed to deal with questions such as these: What is the global financial system and how does it work? What are the pressures on that system including market, regulatory, political and social dynamics? What are the key challenges to that system? How can the system be strengthened? In this course we are defining the global financial system (GFS) as encompassing central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions such as asset managers and private equity firms, financial regulators and international organizations. Thus, we will encompass subjects such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Carlyle Group and the BlackRock Investment Management Co., the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We will take a broad view of the GFS including its history, its geopolitical framework, its economic foundations and its legal underpinnings. We will consider the GFS as a critical public good in the same way that clean air is a public good. We will look at a number of other key issues such as how the GFS deals with economic growth, economic and financial stability, distributional questions, employment issues, and long-term investments in infrastructure. We will discuss how new technologies are affecting several of the biggest issues in global finance. We will examine the GFS as a large-scale complex network, thereby compelling us to see it in an interconnected and multidisciplinary way. The emphasis will be on the practice of global finance more than the theory."

Quarterly earnings, the 24hr news cycle, and social media blips command much of if not most attention. Yet the opportunity set facing business is overwhelmingly shaped by broad macro-trends and systemic risks \u2013 call them \u201cbig issues.\u201d Climate change, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and urbanization are just some of the trends that will make some industries rise while others fall; challenge managers to reinvent their companies, products, and even themselves; and provide exciting opportunities for global leaders who are change agents and entrepreneurs. At the same time, because of business\u2019s ability to adapt to and even steer major change, many stakeholders are looking to the business community to help solve global problems. To meet stakeholder expectations, and to ultimately convert global challenges into business opportunities, aspiring leaders must understand an array of issues that extend far beyond traditional business concerns. Only then can they create \u2018shared value\u2019 at the nexus of business and society. This course is designed to foster participants\u2019 ability to think more holistically about globalization, global trends, and the role of business. It is structured around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of 17 objectives, backed up by 169 specific targets, that were adopted by the UN in 2015 after broad-based consultations involving governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics, and the business community."

      "department": "General Elective",
      "description": "Most of the attention to issues of financial stability focuses on the role of the central bank and prudential regulators in preventing the failure of systemically important financial institutions. As we\u2019ve learned through the experience of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 (GFC), as well as the regional bank failures in the United States and the failure of Credit Suisse in Switzerland in the spring of 2023, preventive efforts are not always successful. The capability of public authorities to manage the orderly failure of systemically important financial institutions, without resort to public support on an open institution basis \u2013 in other words, a bailout that protects the shareholders, creditors, and management of the institution \u2013 has been a goal of the United States and the international community since the 2008 Crisis. The failure of public authorities to have this capability increases the risk of financial crises and erodes public trust and support for preventive efforts. It also creates an unlevel playing field in favor of institutions that are deemed \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and long-run market expectations and moral hazard that lay the groundwork for future financial system instability. The purpose of this course is to review the work on systemic resolution that has been done, both in the United States and internationally, since the 2008 Crisis to develop the capability of public authorities to manage the orderly failure of systemically important banks, both global (GSIBs) and domestic (DSIBs). It will consider the financial stability, accountability, competition, and moral hazard trade-offs between open institution support and resolution and the difficult choices policymakers have to make."

The distribution and management of financial resources can dramatically affect the quality of life, access to opportunities, the overall social fabric of communities, as well as geopolitics. In recent decades, private capital, including private equity, infrastructure and private credit, has become a significant player in society. Private equity managers control tens of trillions of assets. Large pools of sovereign and private wealth emerge, compete for private assets, accumulate returns and gain influence. Private capital not only fuels businesses and innovation but also holds significant influence over public policy and social norms. Understanding the dynamics of private capital is crucial for anyone looking to make informed decisions within the financial sector or engage in policy-making that affects economic growth and social equity. This course is designed for students in finance, economics, public policy, and anyone interested in the intersection of finance and societal development. It offers insights into how financial instruments and decisions can be harnessed to promote sustainable and equitable growth. By examining both the positive and negative impacts of private capital, the course prepares students to contribute thoughtfully and effectively in their future careers, whether in finance, regulation, or social entrepreneurship. The course is co-taught by Professor Song Ma and Dr. Kevin Lu. Song Ma is a Professor of Finance at Yale School of Management. Kevin Lu is a Partner and Chairman of Asia at Partners Group, a global private equity firm with $147 billion AUM.

This course has a mandatory weekly lab meeting and a mandatory off-campus weekend retreat (see important dates for the 2025-2026 academic calendar at https://faculty.som.yale.edu/heidibrooks/interpersonal-and-group-dynamics/). Amidst an epidemic of loneliness and rising levels of burnout\u2014often fueled by interpersonal stressors at work\u2014our capacity to build meaningful connections is essential. Studies have shown that the average manager spends about two-thirds of their time interacting with others. It should be no surprise that skill in interpersonal relationships is one of the most frequent determinants of managerial success or failure. This course is designed to help students learn some of the skills necessary for successfully navigating and leading in the face of fast-paced, complex human interaction. The central focus is to increase students' ability to understand and diagnose interpersonal dynamics as well as to increase personal understanding of how they impact others. This course is a memory-making, powerful and even transformational experience for many students. While readings and group exercises are used to begin discussion, the core learning material emerges in small group interaction. Students learn how they function in small groups and how they relate to others from feedback and reaction of other class members. As such, students planning to enroll should understand that the course methodologies are likely quite different than most courses you have taken to date. Much of the learning will emerge from a) personal reflection on interpersonal and group dynamics and b) the ability/willingness to learn interpersonally from experience, risk-taking, self-disclosure, and feedback. Interested students are encouraged to attend the first session to better understand this unique course experience. Attendance is required for the first two classes to retain a place in the course or on the waiting list. Note that the first assignment requires screening for this course.

Special attention is given to introduce students to formal methods used to analyze energy systems or individual energy projects and to discuss also traditionally lesser-researched elements of energy systems (energy use in developing countries; energy densities and urban energy use; income, gender, and lifestyle differences in energy end-use patterns) in addition to currently dominant energy issues such as energy security and climate change. Active student participation is encouraged, including voluntary (extra credit) research projects with class presentations and participation in student debates. Completion of 6 problem sets and a final written exam are mandatory. Invited external speakers complement topics covered in class. This is a cross-listed course from the School of Environment."

Sometimes, a chance of life or death is literally at stake: how and when should a leader decide to let some people die, or explicitly ask people to die to give others a chance to live? At other times, while life or death may not be at stake, a leader must still decide difficult issues: when to partner with unsavory characters, when to admit failure, when to release information or make choices transparent. The pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and continued instability around the world all make clearer than ever the consequences of decisions in one community that can affect the entire world. This interdisciplinary seminar draws on perspectives from law, management, and public policy in exploring how leaders develop their principles, respond when their principles fail or conflict, and make real-world choices when, in fact, there are no good choices.

      "description": "Most managers find conflict at work to be very uncomfortable. Why? Because often we don't know how to intervene to support team members to resolve their conflicts. Interpersonal conflict arouses feelings, opinions, and decisions that may be uncomfortable to deal with. However, the best time to catch conflict is early, before it escalates. Often team members just need a little support to discuss the conflict and come to their own solutions. And frequently, conflict can be transformed into stronger relationships, or a more open culture, better communication, and increased innovation. That's where this course comes in. While other courses focus on dealing with your own conflicts, this course helps you as a leader step in and facilitate conversations to repair relationships and transform interpersonal conflict among their team members. Using skills and structures that have proven successful in millions of interpersonal conflicts, you will learn to intervene more skillfully in conflicts across culture, functional expertise, gender, age, sexual orientation, and work style preferences, among others. This experiential course will provide you with the leadership and EQ skills, structure, and practice to support your team to resolve work-related conflicts, repair relationships, and feel heard. Through learning by doing, you will learn and hone managerial skills that should be part of every leader's toolbox. We will work in small groups of 3-4 people to apply EQ skills and techniques to real workplace conflicts through role-playing conflicts that commonly occur on diverse teams. As the course progresses, you will have the chance to bring (disguised) conflicts of your own to work on in class. Along with developing and polishing useful conflict resolution skills, you will also leave this course having gotten to know some very interesting people!

This class is designed to help you develop the appropriate toolbox and the appropriate change-making skills to rebuild and reinvent obsolete business models in a wide range of industries. Even in a world that is deeply changing, you can still have impact so long as you give yourself the means to harness and even influence global and business dynamics, as impressive as they might look on paper.
