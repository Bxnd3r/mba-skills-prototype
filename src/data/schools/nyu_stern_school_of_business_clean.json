The cases are chosen because they fulfill the following criteria: 1) The issues addressed are topical 2) They are more nuanced than typical core strategy cases 3) They generate an opportunity to explore related regulatory, technological, social, or organizational content 4) They generate interesting follow up questions. By thoroughly discussing each case and by following up with additional information relevant to the uncertainties faced by the case protagonists, we will generate insights into the challenges of implementing various options. In this course, we seek answers to the following questions: What could go wrong? How do we correct it through better design of structure? The course follows an interactive discussion driven format. My expectation is that you come to class having thoroughly read the assignments for that class. Generally, 3-4 class sessions are led by guests who have many years of experience in the industry under consideration. In addition, some class sessions set aside for group presentations."

      "department": "Elective",
      "description": "The Wall Street Journal once reported that corporate MBA recruiters ranked communication skills as the most important attribute they considered when evaluating applicants. No longer can executives rely on strong technical and analytical skills alone to get them through the day and ensure career advancement. Leaders must not only be able to effectively communicate financial models, analytic results, strategic plans and business forecasts, but be able to do so in a variety of settings, situations and communication channels, while addressing a variety of internal and external audiences. Management Communications is designed for students who seek to improve upon existing communication skills by blending theoretical models for effective persuasion with a practical application of course material in a simulated business environment. The course's \"career life cycle\" concept encompasses a number of individual and group situations that an employee would face over the course of their career. Students working in any number of fields will find this highly interactive course to be challenging and entertaining as they navigate numerous communication events where assessments of the environment, communication modes, team dynamics and \"what's at stake\" play a role to a successful outcome. Most importantly, these exercises and lessons will provide students with communication and situation analysis skills they can put into action immediately as they go about their various business and academic related pursuits."

      "description": "How do you negotiate with many parties? With Godzilla? With other organizations? High stakes? Multiple issues? How do you build a consensus everyone's committed to? How do you act as an agent with constituents and mandates? Deal with talks in the public eye? In short, how do you negotiate corporate life, where things are more challenging than simple one-on-one transactions? In this hands-on, practical continuation of Collaboration, Conflict & Negotiation (CCN), students do a series of increasingly difficult negotiation simulations that help them gain new tools and principles for dealing with the harder talks that happen in corporate life. Students learn to handle multi-party talks, ready for talks with a host of issues using a 'playcard' that gives them 'glance and go' guidance, and deal with highly intimidating counterparts, in part by learning to 'war game.' They also learn to resolve conflicts well even when they have too much responsibility and not enough authority, handle the complex diplomatic challenges of talks between groups and firms, and more. In a capstone simulation, students handle a complex, high-stakes, high-stress, deal on video and then, like athletes, review the tape to discover hidden weaknesses and strengths. CCN is the only pre-requisite. The course complements other Advanced Topics in Negotiation courses and Negotiating Complex Transactions with Executives & Lawyers, which can be taken concurrently or in any order."

      "department": "Elective",
      "description": "Behavioral economics is an emerging subfield that integrates insights from psychology into economic models of behavior. This MBA elective course is intended to inform managers analysts and consultants of the psychological processes and biases underlying our decision making with an emphasis on how to incorporate such insights into business strategies. Successful business strategies depend on a thorough understanding of how consumers and producers make decisions. However traditional models which are founded on the assumption of perfect rationality have serious limitations. Rather than making decisions in the manner predicted by these models consumers and producers often use myriad rules and processes that result in sometimes counterintuitive decisions. For instance consumers have an exaggerated tendency to select compromise or middle options when making choices overpay for warranties buy products they do not use and do not buy products that they later wish they had. Similarly producers overpay for acquisitions persist in investing in losing projects hire the wrong people and design products that result in consumer dissatisfaction. The fact many of these decision errors and biases are systematic has powerful business implications because as this course illustrates it is possible to address them. This course will provide a broad overview of important results from behavioral economics that clarify how consumers and producers really make decisions and investigate how these results can be leveraged to design original and more effective business strategies."

[Long] The field of Finance has traditionally made assumptions of human rationality in decision making in order to facilitate modeling. It has been a great success that has developed powerful Nobel prize-winning theories that are quite consistent with observation \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\" contributions such as portfolio theory, option-pricing, valuation, agency and signaling among others. These contributions have gone on to revolutionize the practice of both investment and corporate finance. However, there remain many anomalies that these traditional models struggle to explain; such as, various anomalies in the price of assets (e.g., why low P/E firms outperform the high ones), the wide swings in stock prices \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\" say relative to the more stable dividends shareholders receive, and why managers attempt to keep earnings stable through Earnings Per Share (EPS) manipulation. The field of Behavioral Finance has put forth explanations for these anomalies and others by relaxing the assumption of the completely rational, disciplined and selfish human. In this course, we define the traditional finance's decision-maker as having three traits: (1) he is only interested in maximizing his own welfare; (2) his models for determining his utility as a function of his actions follow perfect mathematical logic; and (3) the cool, calm and collected decision-maker takes actions without emotional bias. We will find that there are substantial violations of each of these. What behavioral economists call bounded self-interest, bounded rationality and bounded will-power. Thus, humans being aware of them can help themselves in their everyday life as well as in finance, and that they might shed light on some of the anomalies that Traditional Finance have had a hard time explaining."

      "description": "What moves market prices for instruments like stocks? Is it fundamentals like earnings, growth, discount rates etc. or something else like psychology & frictions or a combination of both. Finance theory has long relied on a descriptively sparse model of behavior based on the premise that investors and managers are rational at a collective level and that arbitrage frictions are minimal. In recent years both assumptions have been questioned as the standard model, called the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), fails to account for various aspects of actual fluctuations that appear not to be connected to fundamentals. Behavioral finance (BF) allows for the condition that investors and managers are not always rational and may make systematic errors of judgment that affect market prices. At the extreme these errors are bubbles or crashes. We begin by identifying the respective assumptions of each finance model - EMH and BF and then explore practical, real-world examples of these two model assumptions in liquid markets by examining various investing biases and market frictions."

Why do some people in leadership positions prove effective, while others do not? Why do some high potential people become leaders and others do not? This course tackles these questions. This course is based on the premise that, regardless of your position within an organization, leadership opportunities and challenges present themselves every day and that it is to your advantage to recognize and make the most of these opportunities. Leadership is a behavior (verb), NOT a position (noun). You have to ACT in order to learn and grow, and this class and your time as an EMBA student is the opportunity to do that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 leaders are not made by passive observation! It is also based on the premise that effective leadership requires an in-depth understanding of both yourself and how organizations work, and an in-depth understanding of how to work with and through other people.

      "description": "In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in studying how people make economic choices. Behavioural economics has become a major field in the social sciences. Large numbers of \"biases\" and \"noise\" in which individuals deviate from rational behaviour have been identified, often through experiments. But less attention has been paid to what is meant by \"rational\" behaviour. In this course, we will study why and how rational behaviour in a world of uncertainty cannot be equated with traditional optimising behaviour. Using examples from economics, law and politics, we will explore how people do and should take decisions under uncertainty. Our brains do not function like computers, and for good reason. Successful evolution has given us the capacity to cope with extraordinarily complex situations. The course will use a number of case studies to illustrate decision taking in both business and law."

At the top of the list of such technologies are robotics and mechatronics, which integrate mechanical, electrical, electronics, and computing technologies, as well as software engineering and machine learning, in the design, development, and control of diverse systems used in a range of industries including garment, food, manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and the service industries. Mechatronics makes it possible to design intelligent, reliable, and versatile ectromechanical systems such as industrial robots, medical devices, aircraft simulators, automated assembly lines, building control systems, and autonomous vehicles. Students who are interested in taking this course do not need to have a background in robotics or mechatronics because the course is designed to help students familiarize themselves with both the technical aspects of developing mechatronics and robotics inventions and the research and assessment activities that need to be conducted to turn a viable new technology into a marketable product. To that end, the course will be divided into two key learning modules: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The first module will provide students with a structured process for assessing the commercial viability of a new technology through short lectures and discussions that will focus on the key components of this process, including developing a minimum viable product, conducting customer value proposition research, estimating market potential, identifying key proprietary aspects of a new technology and how to protect them, determining the financial value of a new technology and licensing and royalty fees, and crafting a technology commercialization strategy. This module will also provide students with the opportunity to conduct real-world research and analysis of the commercialization potential of a new robotic technology invention developed at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The second module will provide students with the opportunity to learn about the fundamentals, hardware, software, and applied elements of mechatronics and robotics through short lectures and concrete experiences with devices being developed in the Mechatronics, Controls, and Robotics Lab (MCRL) at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn. These activities will illustrate realworld applications of material covered in the lectures, thus reinforcing and imparting a greater sense of understanding. Having participated in structured mechatronics explorations, students will have greater facility in understanding the mechatronics and robotics inventions that will be the focus of their commercial viability research projects. Career paths for which this course helps students prepare include (1) business development and technology marketing at high-tech start-up companies, (2) corporate venturing, R&D and IP management at large technology development intensive corporations, and (3) analyst or associate positions at venture capital firms.

Rather than pigeonholing selling as \"something done by those sales types,\" we look at it as providing solutions to customer's problems. Selling is unique in that everyone does it. In business, we sell our products, proposals, IPOs, projects, budgets, and anything else that someone else has to approve. In life we buy cars and houses (buying and selling are two sides of the same coin), interview for jobs, propose marriage, and many other things that someone else has to say OK to. In short, selling is a fundamental life skill. The course is primarily an interactive discussion including debates, case discussions, and many small group \"skills drills\" to apply the concepts and methods.

We explore the following question: how does senior level management effectively change an organization in response to dramatic changes in circumstances? All too often managers and corporate boards fail to recognize factors that threaten the firm's business until its very survival is in doubt. In such cases the board of directors and management may need to implement drastic and sudden changes in several aspects of the firm. The course draws on several of the core disciplines in the MBA program and provides an opportunity to apply them to organizations in the midst of major transitions. Students should come into this course ready to integrate various business disciplines- applying both quantitative and qualitative tools drawn from accounting corporate finance cash flow modeling debt restructuring negotiation marketing management leadership and communication. An important aspect of the course is the role of leadership in creating a transformational opportunity resulting from a crisis. Financial market and organizational aspects of transformation will be explored through case studies articles texts and class discussion.The course is relevant for students who anticipate working in any operating company or in a firm advising and/or interacting with such a company- including consultants turnaround specialists venture capital and private equity professionals activist fund managers and bankers. The skills developed in this course should be applicable to professionals throughout their careers. Specific attention is paid to cultivating skills appropriate to early stage career assignments."

In addition, we will discuss other forms of credit derivatives such as Collateralized Loan Obligations, which issue bonds backed by a basket of leveraged loans. As with any derivatives course, the idea is to learn the key arbitrages between derivatives and cash markets well so that one knows when the arbitrage breaks down! Hence, the objective is to provide a balance between developing, on one hand, a sound conceptual framework and, on the other, market understanding and insight, especially with respect to liquidity and counterparty risk effects that are often so important in markets from a practitioner's standpoint. I regard both as essential to the informed practitioner and academic. We will apply the tools by studying signs of market stress during the COVID-19 crisis and how Fed interventions alleviated the market turmoil in that period. In particular, the liquidity in the markets for government bonds will become important to understand as well, especially as COVID stimulus is being withdrawn. Along the way, we will look at methods to quantify the systemic risk of the financial sector and regulatory as well as market-based stress-testing of financial firms. Finally, we will also pay some attention to the ongoing concerns around zombie lending to corporates by bond markets given the Quantitative Easing by central banks both pre-COVID and post-COVID."

It isn't the nature of the underlying crisis that determines whether a company emerges with its operations, reputation, and financial condition intact, but rather the nature of the response.This seven-session elective focuses on the business decisions, management processes, and leadership skills necessary to anticipate, plan for, manage through, communicate about, and recover from crises. A key focus of the course is organizational behavior, especially the ways companies in distress and the stakeholders who matter to those companies predictably behave when things go wrong. Another important focus is leadership: how those who lead organizations can maintain the confidence and trust of internal and external stakeholders.The third is strategy: how to navigate a crisis in such a way as to protect long-term business interests and deliver on critical business strategies. The course examines examples of effective and ineffective crisis management, from BP, HP, Home Depot, Netflix, Toyota, and many others.

More often than not, these daily activities create a trail of digitized data that is being stored, mined, and analyzed by entities in the private (e.g. Google, Wal-Mart) as well as the public and non-profit sectors (e.g academia, government). The general goals of these data driven initiatives is the hope of generating valuable intelligence that is pertinent to business decisions or public policies. For example, customer transaction databases provide vast amounts of high-quality data that can allow firms to understand customer behavior, and customize business tactics to increasingly fine segments or even segments of one. However, much of the promise of such data-driven policies has largely failed to materialize; primarily due to the difficulty of translating data into actionable strategies. The objectives of this course are to fill this gap by training you with the tools and techniques needed to analyze large databases, expose you to a wide variety of issues in an empirical context, and instilling an intuition for D3M, i.e. how to generate insights from the volumes"

Visualization is a graphical representation of some data or concepts. --Colin Ware In this course, students will learn visual representation methods and techniques that increase the understanding of complex data and models. Emphasis is placed on the identification of patterns, trends and differences from data sets across categories, space, and time. How does design of information support meaning and knowledge making? Understanding is a path, not a point. It's a path of connections between thought and thought; patterns over patterns, it is relationships. --Richard Saul Wurman The ways that humans process and encode visual and textual information will be discussed in relation to selecting the appropriate method for the display of quantitative and qualitative data. Graphical methods for specialized data types (times series, categorical, etc.) are presented. Topics include charts, tables, graphics, effective presentations, multimedia content, animation, and dashboard design. The goal of effective visuals is to communicate information to maximize readability, comprehension, and understanding. Information visualization is a combination of many disciplines. Principles are drawn from statistics, graphic design, cognitive psychology, information design, communications, and data mining.

      "description": "Managers can sometimes get a bad rap as bureaucrats and naysayers. Think about it: Doesn't it seem as if \"leadership\" gets all the love? And yet, managers make the (business) world go 'round. Being a great manager can change your own life in powerful ways, but its greatest net positive is in the way it changes those around you, helping to give their lives and careers growth, meaning, and impact. Inasmuch, management is an art, a science, and to paraphrase organizational thinkers from Aristotle to Drucker, \"a noble discipline.\" Developing Managerial Skills covers the wide, exciting, and occasionally daunting gamut of activities comprising that noble discipline. We start at the very beginning, exploring what it takes to assemble a great team through best practices in hiring. Our curriculum then progresses through building a strong culture, making hard decisions with limited information and navigating crises, and the techniques that help you bring out the best in people, so you may bask in their reflected glory. We also explore the ways managers themselves can manage their own careers. (TL;DR: We learn what it really takes to get promoted.) Underlying all of this is the premise that management is good \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and hard. And utterly worth it. After all, when you're an individual contributor, your days and decades are all about maximizing your own impact. That's fine; and it is the right role for some of us. But when you become a manager, you are only as successful as your people and the environment you have constructed to help them grow and flourish. It's all about us."

Some traditional marketing strategies are now completely outdated, others have been deeply transformed, and new digital marketing strategies are continuously emerging based on the unprecedented access to vast amounts of information about products, firms, and consumer behavior. From Twitter to Facebook to Google to Amazon to Apple, the shared infrastructure of IT-enabled platforms are playing a transformational role in today's digital age. The Internet is now encroaching core business activities such as new product design, advertising, marketing and sales, creation of word-of-mouth and customer service. It is fostering newer kinds of community-based business models. Traditional marketing has always been about the 4Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. This course will examine how the digital revolution has transformed all of the above, and augmented them with the 5th P of Participation (by consumers). While there will be sufficient attention given to top level strategy used by companies adopting social media and digital marketing, the focus of the course is also on analytics: how to make firms more intelligent in how they conduct business in the digital age. Measurement plays a big role in this space. The course is complemented by cutting-edge projects and various business consulting assignments that the Professor has been involved in with various companies over the last few years. We will learn about statistical issues in data analyses, assessing the predictive power of a regression, various econometrics-based tools such as simple and multivariate regressions, linear and non-linear probability models (Logit and Probit), estimating discrete and continuous dependent variables, count data models (Poisson and Negative Binomial), cross-sectional models vs. panel data models (Fixed Effects and Random Effects) and various experimental techniques that help can tease out correlation from causality such as randomized field experiments."

The course explores how a digitally interconnected world introduces advantages and efficiencies providing welcomed benefits, and whether these benefits deliver trade-offs, such as the commodification (and exploitation) of personal data giving rise to information oligopolies, socio-economic barriers, and fervent disagreement on the role of digital technology. We will assess the role of government regulation within this dynamic. Our course of study will not transform you into a technology specialist.

The course will include a series of case studies from different industries where accelerating globalization and advancing technology have made these challenges more acute in recent years. The course will focus on the evolving public face of these issues driven in part by rapid developments in the global media and advances in information technology. Today consumers and investors in Manhattan or London are linked almost instantaneously to garment workers in China or Bangladesh, cobalt miners in the Congo or construction workers in Qatar. Consumers of food and beverages know that the cocoa in their food and candy is harvested by young children on West African farms. In these and other industries the news media and social networks are focusing even greater attention on the role of global companies who have become major economic actors on the global stage. The brand reputation of global companies is being tested as media attention to these subjects expands. In addressing these issues, this course will draw upon academic research, case studies and a series of guest speakers from industry and the media to bring these issues to life.

There's not an exact science behind successful entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and product managers. Identifying a genuine market need, building a product to address that need, and finding a business model to tie it all together profitably can't be automated. That said, launching successful high-tech software as a new startup or product is no Voodoo either. While there's no process that guarantees success, savvy entrepreneurs employ market-tested best practices to maximize their chances. High-tech software is built by a cross-functional team of software engineers, data scientists and/or user experience designers. Leading this team towards success requires understanding each role, how they solve problems through effective collaboration, and how to structure customers' desires into the specifications these technologists need to deliver customer-delighting software. After the software's launch, continued success means identifying the metrics which matter the most to guide the software's continued evolution continue to match changing customer tastes and maximize profit. This course will equip you with two toolsets. First, techniques for evaluating market demand on the cheap, patterns for maximizing value capture, models for creating growth from network effects, and protocols for the early identification of symptoms of failure will enable you to get the business started. Second, methods and processes for hiring, inspiring and guiding an engineering team to launch and evolve your software product will enable you to grow your business through delighting your customers. Together, these frameworks prepare you to recognize business opportunities uniquely enabled with software products and successfully launch those products, whether that launch creates your first startup or a new product for your firm."

According to CDC, the US healthcare expenditures increased steeply and reached over 4 trillion dollars. Americans spent over 600 billion on medicine, which includes over the counter (OTC), pharmaceutical and biotech products. There are many challenges impacting consumers/patients, healthcare professionals, drug manufacturers, payers, and government regulators. For instance, as a consumer/patient, have you struggled to schedule a doctor appointment in time, to understand more about your choices for medicines and treatments, and to manage unknown and high medical bills? Additionally, people want to take more control of their own health, therefore we continue to see a booming market for consumer healthcare OTC products, digital healthcare products and wearable devices. On the other hand, pharmaceuticals are facing challenges of limited patent protection period and strong demand to develop the next big therapy. Also, how could pharma and biotech reduce the high probability of failure and cost in drug development? As commercial models are evolving, how to effectively reach and engage HCP and patients becomes more and more critical. Disruptive innovations in therapy are changing market dynamics and infrastructures, such as new diagnostics, drug delivery systems and disease awareness education and campaigns. In this course, we are on the journey to discuss these issues and possible solutions primarily through a marketing/commercial lens.

The main objective of the course is to equip you with the knowledge to prepare, understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non-financial reports used in managing firms. Managing and evaluating companies requires financial and non-financial information about the firm's products, processes, assets, and customers. This information is a key input into a wide range of analytical tools to support decisions: analyzing the profitability of various products, managing product-line portfolios, setting prices, measuring and managing the profitability of customers, making operational and strategic decisions, evaluating investments, investigating efficiency, and so on. The focus of this course is on information generated by internal accounting systems. Along the way, we will discover that many companies have not provided their managers with useful information. These managers have to rely on information systems designed years ago for very different business processes and with very different technologies. We will take a look at a number of pitfalls that these systems can induce and at the dangers of using these systems to make business decisions. We will also investigate some modern ideas on how an organization's information system should be designed. To attain the right level of understanding, you will need to be familiar with the mechanics of the many techniques used to prepare management reports.

      "description": "While the promotion of tech entrepreneurship has grown substantially in the past 20 years, core entrepreneurship -- small business owner-operators -- are still the vast majority of occurances of running a business. These are not high-profile nor receive the headlines but are the greatest wealth creator in the US economy. In the past 30 years, a variant on this small business owner-operator model has emerged: Entrepreneurship through Acquisition (ETA). ETA takes a small-to-midsized business (SMB) that has achieved some level of product-market fit as well as financial stability and acquires the company putting a new CEO -- oftentimes a newly minted MBA -- in place to drive growth and optimization. Since many SMBs are run as \"lifestyle\" businesses, the current owner has little incentive to grow them beyond what meets their personal financial needs. This has a dual effect of a) suppressing acquisition multiples (typically 3-6x EBITDA) and b) creating ample opportunities for immediate financial impact under professional management. This creates an attractive asset class for investors which, over the past 30 years, has achieved 3x the returns vs. traditional mid-to-large private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC)."

How will the wants, needs, and expectations of our customers and our society change as a result of this trend? We will systematically explore the future in order to forecast it so that we might all make better decisions in the present. This is not a class about today's hottest trends, though I will o\u00ef\u00ac\u0080er deep insights into what key areas to watch. Instead, this class presents a process for identifying and acting on those trends. No technical skills are required. You don't need to be a statistician or a research scientist.

      "description": "This course will teach students frameworks for managing AI for business and policy. This course will take the manager's perspective. Familiarity with any new technology is an important goal for managers, so that competitive and corporate strategies can be aligned to take advantage of potential new opportunities and guard against potential risks. But new technologies don't appear in a vacuum. They are commercialized against a backdrop of macro-economic trends and cultural norms, and their adoption may depend on these factors as well as industry-specific and firm-specific factors. For example, a firm's relationship with its employees may have direct consequences for decision to adopt a new technology, or the manner in which a new technology is adopted. This course will provide students with a set of strategy and management frameworks that firms use when assessing how to implement AI in their own organizations, how to use AI as a competitive tool in the market place, and how to interact with government actors. To accomplish these goals, the course will use a variety of popular press readings, academic research papers, cases and in-class presentations."

These shareholders include founders and their families, the state, private equity firms, activist investors like hedge funds, other institutional investors, and employees acting in concert. Through their presence or representation on the company's board of directors, their voting power\u00e2\u0080\u0094often enhanced over their sheer equity stakes through dual-class stock or other governance mechanisms, these shareholders are often the ultimate decision-makers on strategic matters like mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, etc. This course seeks to deepen your' understanding of the strategic role played by shareholders in companies where there is some degree of concentrated ownership. Through discussions of cases and recent articles, we will analyze the impact of these shareholders on competitive and corporate strategies, and ultimately on firm performance and other outcomes (the \"what\"); the governance structures and mechanisms that enable them to shape those strategies (the \"how\"); and the different motives that drive these owners' strategic actions (the \"why\"). The course is designed to prepare you to: (a) be good strategic owners yourselves, if you choose a career path in entrepreneurship (including social entrepreneurship), private equity, hedge funds, search funds, or your own family business, and/or (b) work effectively with such owners in your role as managers or strategic advisors, if you choose a career path in consulting, investment banking, M&A advising, or general management"

Typically, logistics-related costs account for 20 to 25 percent of firms' total costs. On the revenue side, the supply chain decisions have a direct impact on market penetration and customer service. With the globalization of the economy and advances in information technology, supply chain design and coordination have become important tools for gaining competitive advantage. Therefore, the objectives of the course are to (1) develop an understanding of individual components of the supply chain (such as order management transportation, network design, distribution channel management, after-sales service, and customer service strategy) and their interrelationships with other functions of firms, such as marketing, manufacturing, and accounting; (2) impart analytical and problem-solving skills necessary to develop solutions for a variety of logistics problems; (3) understand the complexity of interfirm and intrafirm coordination in implementing programs such as \"quick response\" and \"vendor-managed inventories\" and (4) develop the ability to design logistics systems and formulate integrated supply chain strategy, so that all components are not only internally synchronized but also tuned to fit corporate strategy, competitive realities, and market needs."

      "description": "This course provides an overview of the way sustainability (environmental, social and governance) factors are analyzed in private markets. It focuses on preparing students to implement their understanding of the financial and societal risks and opportunities within the investment making process. In private markets, limited partners (pension funds, endowments, high net-worth individuals) have pushed the sustainability imperative and social consciousness of private equity funds and asset managers by seeking greater clarity around how their money is invested in both a responsible and financially meaningful way. Alongside this trend, an evolving regulatory environment globally has propelled the need to systemize evaluation frameworks for stakeholders within investment functions and advisors who support them. Unlike public markets, sustainability information is harder to glean in private markets and requires a skilled extraction and evaluation process. During this course, we examine a traditional ESG due diligence process embedded within the wider investment lifecycle (sourcing, diligence, hold and exit) through the lens of changing geographic regulatory landscape in financial investing and the market leading frameworks that quantify ESG factors for evaluation. The course culminates with a deal due diligence process that mimics an investment committee (IC) comprised of private equity leaders that understand the commercial and purpose-driven viability of an investment."

Some students have taken both courses and found them to be valuable. We illustrate a streamlined and structured framework to analyze business drivers of forty tech companies. This helps us understand their narrative, drill into their financial statements, and assess competitive advantage. The analysis proceeds as follows: (1) We apply the Six-Pack Framework for a top-down and comprehensive analysis of financial statements to extract the six key inputs into valuation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Size, Growth, Margins, Asset intensity, Business risk, and Financial risk. (2) We analyze how these inputs depend upon a company's strategy by computing the Competitive Advantage Score that assigns weights to competitive drivers and scores the company's strength on those drivers. This broad exposure will expand your tech horizons and enable you to foresee challenges and opportunities due to changing competition, technology, and environment. The framework and the perspective will sharpen your ability to lead value creation as a tech entrepreneur or executive, or to understand value creation as an investor, banker, analyst, or consultant."

Tech is no longer a vertical and now requires workers to be well versed in how to develop, create and manage technology either as a business or a key element thereof. The modern approach to technology development and management arose out of entrepreneurial technology ventures which are now some of the largest companies in the world. Even at scale, those companies are still nimble and innovative -- let alone the next generation of them which are constantly emerging. This, plus the fact that technology is now in now important in every industry, has incumbents scrambling to be competitive. One way they are doing this is hiring people with technology experience. However, they are also re-organizing into product-customer centric iterative and experimental technology organizations. There has never been more competition for tech workers. In the 21st century organization -- learning from tech companies -- the key roles revolve around engineering (software & hardware), design, data science and product management. Of the four, the first three have advanced academic program but the last, product management, has no academic offering meaning workers must gain knowledge and experience on the job. The trap is that most PM jobs require experience. Those trying to break into a tech role as a PM cannot easily gain that. This course is designed to cover advanced topics and scenarios a product manager faces in the real world across a wide variety of product types, industries and organizational structures ranging from startups to large organizations.

For example the burst of the stock market bubble in 2000-2001 and its role in the 2001 recession the stimulative effect on economic activity that a major and sustained bond market rally can engineer etc."

      "department": "Elective",
      "description": "This course shows students how economic policy gets made, and should get made, at the highest levels of federal government. It draws upon almost fifty years of economic policy-making, and the challenges that have confronted the men and women who have sat in positions of power in the Treasury, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, and the National Economic Council. These challenges include the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system and the transition to a predominantly floating exchange rate world, the era of rampant inflation, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the transition to market economies, the shock of 9/11, the financial crisis of 2008, and the Great Recession that followed. Lectures and discussions will lead to in-class exercises, in which students will role- play as advisers to US presidents from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump. What is it like to sit in the Oval Office and discuss policy with the president? To know that your input into his decisions will impact millions of people? To know that the wrong advice could be calamitous? Students will learn how to analyze policy problems and design solutions, taking into account the multi-dimensional aspects of making federal policy and the many constraints upon those decisions, including of course the influence of Congress. As part of the learning process, students will also have the opportunity to hear from guest speakers who have worked at the very top of economic policy-making in the executive branch of government, and played a role in the policy-making process through their work in the media."

      "department": "Elective",
      "description": "Business success requires being different. To succeed, a business needs to stand out from the competition. This is what business strategy courses teach, and they are right. But finding a way to be different is harder than just knowing that it is important to be different. This is the fundamental challenge facing the business strategist. It is the challenge of looking at an existing organization and coming up with ways to make its position in the marketplace more distinctive. Or, it is the challenge of looking at the potential of a new business and creating a distinct position for it. The strategist is equally important in the worlds of existing enterprise and of entrepreneurship. The challenge of being different is considerable. Much of the time, everyone has access to more or less the same knowledge base. This is likely even more the case today, in a globally interconnected world, relative to the past. In this environment, the key to being different becomes one's ability to think differently. Of course, one has to think both differently and better, and come up with not just a different but a superior business proposition. Out-thinking others in this way is the job of the business strategist. In this course, we will develop a four-way framework to help us think differently and better and become better business strategists. The four components of the framework (4 C's) are: Strategy from Contrast Strategy from Combination Strategy from Constraint Strategy from Context We will examine many examples of great business strategies of each of these four types, and we will also use this framework to help us generate entirely new strategies."

In the second module, we will discuss the centrality of payment structure and incentive design in health care in determining quality and costs. We will then discuss new contracting models and payment approaches intended to incentivize value-driven health care including accountable care organizations, payment bundling, and patient-centered medical care. In the third module, we will cover new models of health care delivery and assess their value propositions. This course will cover issues across the health care delivery spectrum including inpatient, outpatient, long term care, and prescription drug markets. Particular focus will be placed on the tradeoffs between efficiency and equity in the pursuit of value, the role of big data and technology in facilitating new value-driven initiatives, the importance of evaluation and evidence-based decision-making, and the effect of secular trends including aging demographics and consolidation/common ownership across the health care system.

Markets are being reshaped at an unprecedented pace, creating a world where disruption is common-place and innovation is not only expected but increasingly necessary. Every player is entering the race to win with the next big bet - entrepreneurs working at start-ups and venture studios, and intrapreneurs, working within corporations, all vying for a piece of the rapidly changing market. Building new ventures, as an entrepreneur or intrapreneur, has become a coveted skill. This course focuses on teaching that skill, de-mystifying the process and the complexity of creating new ventures and delving into the core steps, techniques and tools that transcend industry and objective. The goal of the course is to prepare students with navigating the uncertainty inherent in building new products, services and lines of business, regardless of their path as venture builders. Students will immerse in the venture building process through the hands-on creation of their own idea, learning how to identify and size a market opportunity, segment customers and define a unique value proposition and business model. Individually or in groups, students will select a project path: venture building for themselves (entrepreneurs) or from within an existing company (intrapreneurs). They will learn, from in-class lecture and detailed case studies, how to move from initial hypothesis to proof of concept, and then apply those learnings to their own idea. Students will be asked to share and evolve their work, in response to feedback and external forces, as occurs in the real world. As the course progresses, so will their ideas, following the arc of venture building and allowing students to absorb the core tools necessary to determine and stress-test their path forward as entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs."
