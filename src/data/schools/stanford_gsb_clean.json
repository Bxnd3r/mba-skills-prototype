      "department": "OB",
      "description": "In 2009 a student who was about to graduate said to me, \"Being coached at the GSB helped me grow over the last two years, but after I leave school and no longer have access to these resources, how will I continue to coach myself?\" This course is an attempt to help you answer that question. I define self-coaching as the process of guiding our own growth and development, particularly through periods of transition, in both the professional and personal realms. In this course you'll explore a range of practices and disciplines intended to help you build on what you've learned about yourself at the GSB and continue that process after graduation. Classes will consist of a mix of short lectures, exercises, small group discussions, and conversations in pairs. While this is a self-directed process, it's also highly social and interactive. You'll work with in pairs and small groups in every class session, so be prepared to discuss meaningful personal issues with your fellow students. Because every class session involves extensive interaction with other students, missing a class would negatively affect other students' learning. As a result, your are obligated to attend every class session. One unexcused absence will lower your grade a full level, and more than one unexcused absence will result in a U. For students taking the class Pass/Fail, an unexcused absence may result in a failing grade."

Preparation includes case studies involving both qualitative and quantitative analyses; homework assignments involving quantitative and some qualitative analyses; pre-class online quizzes and most importantly, a group project involving the design of a new business model that takes advantage of modern IT. Some classes will cover an aspect of a business model which is enabled by IT in an industry which is or was transformed by information technology. Others will focus on the application of these concepts to new business models (e.g., the ones developed in the final project). Students opting to go into technology would probably benefit the most from the course, but this will require a significant time commitment."

      "course": "OB380: Negotiations Lab",
      "department": "OB",
      "description": "The ability to negotiate effectively and confidently is a learnable skill. It all starts with a foundation of basic principles and the space to experiment with how you respond in different negotiation scenarios. The negotiations lab provides you with both. First we'll focus on the basic principles through definitions, examples, and simulation exercises. As you get a handle on the principles, we'll then shift focus to experimenting with how you personally might respond in different scenarios. A key premise of the class is that different interpersonal styles can be equally effective in obtaining the desired outcome, but you need to identify what can work for you, from pacing to precise phrases. To facilitate this experimentation, you'll receive feedback with your peers and systematically reflect on the process. The lab will be co-taught by a lecturer with a long history of business negotiations. Several guests will visit to speak about negotiations in their particular area of expertise. As a final project, you will also develop a negotiation case. Doing so requires thinking through the precise structure of a negotiation and thinking through how the parties perceive the positions and asks of the others. You are encouraged to draw on personal experiences to develop the case."

      "department": "LECON",
      "description": "There is a growing awareness that many of the key challenges in fostering development in poor societies are political challenges. What can we do to encourage trade, cooperation and peace in environments riven with social and ethnic divisions? How do we foster broadly beneficial political reforms and good governance when the potential losers to reforms are able to mobilise to prevent them? How do we detect and mitigate the effects of corruption? What role may modern finance play in creating or mitigating political economy challenges in developing countries?These problems are modern and endemic, but many are also old problems, and economic theory and the practical experiences of different countries have much to tell us both about what has worked in the past, and what policy experiments we may try in new environments. Rather than a survey, the objective of this course is to selectively discuss new and open research areas in political development economics and the theoretical and empirical tools necessary to contribute to them, with the topics chosen to complement other Stanford courses in applied microeconomics, development, political economics and economic history. By the end of the course, the student will have analysed a theoretical or historical solution to a key political development challenge and proposed a natural or field experiment to test it empirically. Graduate level proficiency in microeconomics and empirical methods will be required."

      "department": "MKTG",
      "description": "The objective of this course is to introduce you to modern marketing practice at an accelerated level. Marketing is key to the success of an organization and requires an ability to design and execute a coherent strategy across a number of different dimensions. Specifically, we study in depth each of the tactical P's - price, promotion, product, and place (distribution) - and do so through the structural lens of the three C's - customer, competition, and company, with a particular focus on the customer. Going beyond the fundamentals, the course emphasizes two specific areas of specialization and learning throughout. First, it focuses on data-driven techniques for assessing markets and teaches you which of these techniques apply to different marketing decision problems. Second, the course takes seriously the idea that consumers often want different things. It therefore focuses on how you can generate company value by understanding and serving heterogeneous consumer wants and needs."

Yet, critical IP decisions are usually made by lawyers with very little input from management. The purpose of this class is to provide business leaders with the tools, models and institutional knowledge to actively participate in managing and growing their company's IP assets as strategic business assets (with a focus on patents). This class will explore the value of corporate IP assets by thinking strategically on how to effectively leverage the knowledge, trade secrets, patents, technologies, trademarks, structures and processes that are critical across industries. We will focus on the elements of a successful IP strategy, and how that strategy is shaped by economic, technology, legal, regulatory, and market factors. Through a combination of case studies (including a group strategy project), analysis of current events, class discussion and guest speakers, we will cover a variety of issues shaping a successful IP strategy in today's global business environment. Some of the topics covered include: * Building and managing an IP portfolio that is aligned with business objectives;* Understanding the forces shaping the IP marketplace in the US and in foreign markets;* The innovation cycle and technology transfer mechanisms;* Using big data analytics in making IP decisions;* IP portfolio monetization strategies (e.g., licensing, sale, enforcement);* IP considerations in Mergers & Acquisitions;* IP valuation and current trends in patent transactions;* Managing corporate IP litigation risk (patent trolls, incumbent litigation);* IP strategies for start-ups & entrepreneurs.Ms. Efrat Kasznik is an IP valuation and strategy expert with more than twenty years of experience advising companies of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 100s, on extracting value from their IP.

The course will start with an overview of leading theories of organizations, all of which were effectively modeled on the 20th century firm. We will then turn to understanding recent developments in machine learning and AI, from the point of view of an informed user (rather than a technical developer), ranging from foundation language models to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) implemented using blockchain technology. These will form the basis for an ongoing discussion about the future of organizations in the age of AI. Is this merely another phase in the modern organization's evolution, is this a paradigmatic redefinition of its structure and function, or is this a cataclysmic moment heralding the end of organizations as the central building blocks of economic activity? We will (speculatively) discuss these issues from a broad perspective, investigating how AI is already impacting work and organizational structures, as well as these changes' broader social implications (such as their effect on work/life balance, the gendered division of labor in the household, and the structure of community). The implications for business and management are clear: AI is already impacting organizational life, and will continue to do so as technologies mature and their business models are refined."

      "description": "Our seminar is designed for students interested in improving their communication skills. Right now, you probably don't spend much time thinking about the way you communicate, nor are you likely, in the academic setting, to get much feedback on the messages you send. Yet the quality of your communication will have a large impact on your overall effectiveness in building relationships and getting things done, both in the university setting and later in your career. Each of the sessions in our seminar will help you appreciate the nature and complexity of communication and provide guidelines for both improving your communication style and recognizing the unique styles of others. In each class session, we'll consider a number of well-studied forms of interpersonal communication. And, we'll rely heavily on experiential learning to bring the concepts to life. For example, to better understand the dynamics of unstructured, spontaneous communication, we will participate in an improvisational theatre workshop, taught by one of the artists-in-residence at the Groundlings Theater in Los Angeles. To better understand persuasive communication tactics, we'll participate in role-play exercises, competitive games, and negotiation simulations. For each tactic, we'll talk about why it works, when it works best, and what its limitations might be. We'll discuss how you can put these approaches to work in order to support your goals. After taking this course, you will be better able to: (1) identify strategies for crafting effective communication in the form of everyday conversation, written work, and public presentations, (2) develop techniques for building strong, long-term relationships with your peers, and (3) become more persuasive in advancing an agenda, acquiring resources, or gaining support from others. These skills will be invaluable to you as you grow and develop here at Stanford and beyond."

      "description": "Today, AI-enabled ventures in developing economies are reaching small and mid-sized businesses, a growing middle class, and the base of the pyramid with products that improve daily life and unlock new opportunities. Much of this progress rides on a familiar interface: messaging. In Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, millions first came online through WhatsApp or similar apps, so the conversational nature of generative AI - chat and voice - feels instantly intuitive. Yet turning a clever demo into a durable company still requires the right scaffolding: talent pipelines, capital, and clear rules. Founders may call the same cloud APIs and fine-tune the same open-source models as their Silicon Valley peers, but their operating realities are radically different. Ecosystems of universities, incubators, angel networks, and early-stage funds remain shallow, and entrepreneurs must navigate small domestic markets, scarce scale-up capital, limited talent pools, and fluid political and legal environments. At the same time, unprecedented capital is flowing in because the digital toolkit is broader and cheaper than ever. Generative AI and applied ML now headline a stack that also includes blockchain rails, IoT sensors, and ubiquitous smartphones. Crucially, vast pools of structured data - e-invoices, land registries, informal credit logs - sit trapped in legacy systems; startups that unlock and fine-tune models on this local data gain an immediate moat. Opportunities range from replicating proven models and leapfrogging obsolete tech to serving the base of the pyramid or spinning up new VC firms. But winning still demands more than product - market fit and go-to-market muscle: it requires relentless localisation, a sober view of where AI truly adds leverage, and flawless execution under often-adverse conditions."

We will then turn to understanding recent developments in machine learning and AI, from the point of view of an informed user (rather than a technical developer), ranging from foundation language models to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) implemented using blockchain technology. These will form the basis for an ongoing discussion about the future of organizations in the age of AI. Is this merely another phase in the modern organization's evolution, is this a paradigmatic redefinition of its structure and function, or is this a cataclysmic moment heralding the end of organizations as the central building blocks of economic activity? We will (speculatively) discuss these issues from a broad perspective, investigating how AI is already impacting work and organizational structures, as well as these changes' broader social implications (such as their effect on work/life balance, the gendered division of labor in the household, and the structure of community). The implications for business and management are clear: AI is already impacting organizational life, and will continue to do so as technologies mature and their business models are refined.

Hence, the first aim of the course is to develop your ability to analyze conflict and negotiation situations. Concepts from the course will enable us to look beneath the surface rhetoric of a conflict, to isolate the important underlying interests at stake, and to determine what sort of negotiated settlement (if any) is feasible in a given situation. In addition to understanding how to analyze conflict and negotiation situations, to manage effectively, you must have a broad repertoire of behavioral skills that can be applied to the various conflict and negotiation situations you are likely to encounter. Therefore, a second aim of the course is to allow you to experience various bargaining situations by playing a role in simulated negotiations. Our exercises will allow you to try out tactics that might feel uncomfortable trying in an actual negotiation, get constructive feedback from your counterparts and classmates, and learn how you come across. This course is an intense, compact version of longer negotiation courses (electives OB381 and OB581); thus, students should not take either of these courses as there is considerable overlap among the three.

Americans spend more than $648 billion annually on care, and it is expected to grow. There is a significant labor shortage of trained caregivers. In 2025, 63 million American adults provided ongoing care to adults or children with a medical condition or disability - representing almost one-quarter of all adults in the United States. The infant and childcare market is similarly unaffordable, fragmented, and broken. Every business leader today is confronting the complexities of a workforce of young parents, often challenged to find care for their children and/ or their parents and family members. These markets, often referred to as the Care Economy, are overlooked and ripe for reinvention with the potential for enormous social impact. This course will expose students to key insights about the Care Economy from five perspectives: business leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, caregivers and policymakers. We will explore the spectrum of care needs from infants and children to older adults, and how other developed countries such as Singapore, Denmark, and Japan have created their care systems and addressed the needs of working families. During the course, students will meet several distinguished business and thought leaders working to build a better care system, including the CEO of a leading care navigation company, major investors in the Care Economy, and key leaders and policy innovators spearheading public-private partnerships for caregiving. The course will include cases, panels with innovators and entrepreneurs, class exercises and care workshops, and lectures. Class topics will include the ROI of care to employers; the caregiving ecosystem; the different needs and complexities of caring for infants, children, older adults, and those with disabilities; and understanding the payors.

The course will introduce students to an active research area whose scholars have largely been inspired by the late Jim March. We will study the basic elements of behavioral approaches to organizations and consider how new contributions can be made in this area. The course will also give students opportunities to familiarize themselves with agent-based modelling, which has been one of the preferred methods of behavioral theorists. Students will be able to discuss papers based on such models, but also develop simple models to formalize theoretical arguments."

This course invites you to reflect on the kind of leader you aspire to be, the kind of leader you currently are, and how to align your behavior with your leadership goals. You will have an opportunity to share in the leadership of your squad and, in doing so, to discover your strengths and challenges as a leader. You will receive feedback about your approach to leadership and have the opportunity to try out new skills and tools. Your squad is made up of you and five of your classmates, who will work together in Leadership Labs every week of the quarter. At your weekly meetings, your squad will engage in a mix of experiential exercises, case role plays, and team discussions and negotiations. You and your squadmates will develop individual learning goals to support your personal leadership development. As the quarter progresses, you will track and discuss productive and unproductive dynamics in the squad. All of these activities are designed to help you think more deeply about how your squad is working together and to allow you to practice and experiment with new ways of leading. You will have the opportunity to give and receive a great deal of feedback so you and your squad mates can achieve a deeper understanding of the impact of your behaviors on others. And many of the activities your squad will do together will be video recorded for your self-review afterwards. In each Lab session, one squad member will be the Meeting Lead for the session. MBA1 squad members will rotate through the Meeting Lead position. Your squad will have a dedicated MBA2 Leadership Fellow who will be present for these meetings to provide team coaching to the squad as a whole. You will also meet with your Fellow for individual coaching support outside the weekly Labs sessions. Finally, the quarter culminates with the Executive Challenge, an opportunity for you to further refine your leadership skills by engaging with alumni judges in role plays that test your ability to lead effectively. The alumni will evaluate your performance and provide feedback."

The course includes 3 days of class instruction and 3 days in the field meeting with innovative organizations who are dealing with these challenges. Master's students will reside in the residence halls of Kellogg College at Oxford for the entire program. This course is designed to help you develop in three fundamental ways: To learn about the essential environmental and human changes now emerging as the world's ecosystem changes; To think originally and objectively about the social, economic, political, and technological dynamics involved in the world's sustainability crises; To begin work on how you, as a future leader, might be able to address the world's sustainability challenges during your life and career. The course is organized around a central idea: How we address sustainability challenges depends on the perspective we take when trying to understand these challenges. The course is designed to help you to become aware of the power of perspective, and how you can intentionally choose to view challenges from multiple perspectives in order to achieve a more complete understanding and become an effective leader. Specifically, we will discuss three broadly differing perspectives: 1. The behavioral lens: Asking 'Why is this happening?' 2. The technical lens: Asking 'How can this problem be solved?' 3. The moral lens: Asking 'What should be happening?'"

      "description": "This graduate seminar investigates the theory of social computation underlying the interdisciplinary field of computational social science (CSS), with an emphasis on exploring the intersection of cognitive science, computational sociology, and theoretical economics. It aims to identify not only how recent innovations in computational theory can provide new ways of understanding social systems as computational systems, but also how social systems can provide new ways of understanding the structure and nature of computation itself. It covers foundational discoveries in CSS to date that are grounded in well-defined mathematical and/or simulation-based models, as well as successfully validated with empirical data from experiments and observational studies. Each class is organized to examine a potential feature and/or dynamic of social systems that may (or may not, as we shall discuss) be considered a defining constitutive characteristic of uniquely social computation. The features/dynamics covered in the seminar include social network structure, social contagion and diffusion (i.e., the spread of ideas and behaviors through populations), collective intelligence and the wisdom of crowds, conventions and social norms, categories and analogies, cultural markets and path dependent historical evolution, innovation, ranking systems, and search processes, and the macro dynamics of organizations that coordinate and aggregate collective cognition and behavior. The penultimate class reviews current efforts to use large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence more generally to imitate human agents in controlled psychological tasks and simulated social network environments, with the aim of examining (i) whether these artificial agents can serve as viable models for predicting, identifying, and explaining the computational dynamics of social systems, and (ii) whether these models can be improved toward this end using the theory of social computation explored in this seminar."

While financial statement users face a wide variety of decisions, they are often interested in understanding the implications of financial statement information for the future cash flows and earnings potential of a firm. We will focus on understanding the mapping between underlying economic events and financial statements, and on understanding how this mapping affects inferences about future profitability and liquidity. The following learning objectives will be emphasized: (1) familiarity with the transactions businesses engage in, (2) fluency in accounting terminology, (3) understanding the structure that maps transactions into accounting numbers, (4) understanding the rationale for various accounting methods, and (5) awareness of the judgment involved and the discretion allowed in choosing accounting methods, making estimates, and disclosing information in financial statements."

The course is not designed to cover issues such as execution of a strategy (although we will touch on this a bit), but on whether to enter a market to begin with. Thus, the course is decision oriented; we want you to think about market entry decisions and how you would make them. The tools that you will be provided won't consist of equations; instead, we'll arm you with a set of questions to ask, whose answers will help you make better decisions.This course is an advanced applications marketing course. Unlike the base core course that is designed to cover every basic topic in marketing, here we focus on a number of basic questions and explore them in depth. Although we will have some lectures for background, the bulk of this endeavor will be accomplished through case discussions. In other words, we can't and won't cover everything, as this course is not designed to be comprehensive.

This course will help you develop the skills and strategies necessary to effectively create and evaluate educational services and education technology startups, much like educators, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and venture capital investors do. Some questions we will discuss include: How do entrepreneurs, educators, and VCs evaluate and grow successful education and edtech startups? Why do most startups in edtech fail, and what are the critical ingredients for success, especially in today's challenging times? What does it take to get venture capital financing in edtech? Why now? Each week will feature a different entrepreneur as a guest speaker; these leaders hail from a variety of innovative for-profit and non-profit startups. As we hear from the speakers, we'll evaluate all aspects of their invention, particularly in the context of AI, distance learning and hybrid learning ecosystems. A fundamental question we'll explore in this course is how educators and technologists can better collaborate to leverage the scale and impact of technology to improve educational equity and access.

Students taking the course are expected to have had at least one college course in operations management, and familiar with methodologies like queueing systems, newsvendor model, safety stocks, and process flow analysis, as these methodologies will not be taught in class, but they are used in analyzing global operations in class sessions, in assignments, and in exam."

OB330 and OB331 together are the academic component of this program and run the entirety of both Autumn and Winter Quarters. Students earn 4 credits in the Autumn and 4 credits in the Winter. Both quarters must be completed to receive any units of credit. The course is open only to those students who have applied and been accepted into the Leadership Fellows Program. Interested students apply at the start of Winter Quarter of their first year and undergo a competitive application process, after which successful applicants are invited to take part in the program. Informational meetings are held late in Autumn Quarter and during the first week of Winter Quarter and Fellows are selected from the first year class in mid- Winter Quarter. Knowing how to develop others is a crucial leadership competency. In this class, Fellows develop the advanced leadership skills of leading leaders and developing others through coaching and mentoring. Among the competencies developed in this class are Team Coaching, Individual Coaching and Personal Development skills. In the Autumn Quarter Fellows are assigned to a squad of six MBA1s in Leadership Labs. Fellows guide their MBA1 squad through the learning process in the Labs and provide both individual and team coaching to their MBA1 squad members. In addition to the work with their MBA 1 squad, Fellows provide in-depth 1:1 coaching to three additional MBA1 students who are not members of their squad as part of the Personal Leadership Coaching (PLC) program. The PLC coaching begins after Autumn midterms and continues through the end of Winter Quarter. Fellows classes meet twice a week for 105 minutes. There will be a reading list of conceptual material which will be supplemented during class with lectures discussions and activities. Students will apply concepts through role-playing and experiential exercises during class time as well as in their coaching and mentoring of their MBA1 coachees. Additionally, Fellows will attend weekly Leadership Labs with the first year squad to which they have been assigned and meet 1:1 with MBA1 coachees. Fellows meet regularly with five of their peers in \"clinics,\" standing groups led by experienced coaches who are also Lecturers at the GSB. Fellows meet with their Leadership Coach and clinic approximately every other week during regular class time to discuss specific strategies for working with their first year students. Fellows also periodically meet with their Leadership Coach one-on-one to hone their skills and explore their areas for specific improvement. Note: OB374, Interpersonal Dynamics, is a PRE-REQUISITE for this course; students who want to be Fellows are advised to assess whether that is a class they want to take in the spring quarter of their first year."

The second part begins with integrated assessment models and reasons for disagreement among prominent models. (Students are expected to understand public goods dilemmas and free-riding.) It then proceeds to an obvious but often overlooked basic and essential fact: these models upon which all activist and government actions are based are unrealistic academic exercises. They are not even asking the right questions. Thus, United Nations treaties and carbon footprint initiatives are distractions rather than solutions. The third part discusses where clean and other technology is as of 2022 and what it will still take to reduce global warming. It also discusses why some prominently proposed technologies are hopeless, too; while other cheaper actions have remained unused (lost opportunities). Dissent and discussion, seminar-style, is encouraged. The grade will be based primarily on a midterm and take-home final, with some flexibility for students interested in doing more."

      "description": "This course is designed for students interested in a unique look at entrepreneurship, early-stage investing, and venture capital. The venture capital ecosystem is going through a dramatic cycle as US venture capital investment dropped from a record high of over $350B in 2021 to less than half that level ($165B) in 2023. We then witnessed a slight recovery of VC investment to $215B in 2024. As we navigate through tariffs, inflation and an uncertain economy in 2025 and 2026, venture capitalists are likely to retain the power at the negotiating table. The notable exception is for a select number of seed stage entrepreneurs and AI related investments where entrepreneurs have an advantage. Many investors and entrepreneurs look at this chaotic environment as a time to return to safe harbors by reducing risk. We suggest a more adventurous strategy. Our course offers alternatives to what many advisors consider `best practices'. Our goal is to improve your ability to create or invest in a breakthrough idea. Many of these concepts come from the course textbook, Pattern Breakers, by Mike Maples, Jr and Peter Ziebelman. The course is designed to give you the tactical tools to proactively and confidently navigate this chaotic environment. You will hear from over 15 investors and half dozen entrepreneurs. Students have enjoyed our differentiating speaker format -- instead of just one guest speaker, we invite two speakers for many of the class sessions. Our two-speaker technique allows for an unscripted discussion about the class topic or case. The course is designed to complement other popular GSB courses about entrepreneurship such as Startup Garage, Formation of New Ventures, and Lean Launchpad. Our course gives you that tactical edge with a special combination of two class projects, guest speakers and case-based instruction. You will be able to apply what you learn as we (and the guest speakers) offer candid and instant feedback. The course is fast paced with very current content. Notably, students are permitted to use the same business idea in our course's team project that they use for a different course (with instructor permission). If you do not have a business idea or market sector interest, we will team you with another student with similar interests. We offer class topics that are typically not covered in other business school courses - such as how to find and use the power of early stage advisors and board members in building and funding a company, how to find that ideal co-founder and figure out the equity split amongst the founding team, and what do VCs say behind closed doors at the VC's partners' meeting after the founder gives their funding pitch? The course attracts students from diverse backgrounds (we intentionally reserve 10 seats for graduate students from outside the GSB). Students range in experience from serial entrepreneurs to students who are experimenting with entrepreneurship for the first time. We also see students with significant investment experience share their start-up investor experience as they add to the class dynamic."

OVERVIEW: This course offers a compressed version of OB374 Interpersonal Dynamics (aka 'Touchy Feely'), designed to provide a rich, growth-oriented experience in a group setting. It focuses on the learning and application of interpersonal skills while being less intensive and time consuming than the full OB374 course (Link to FAQ & a comparison of both courses). Learning occurs primarily through structured in-class activities, small learning groups, outside practice, and a weekend T-group retreat. The course includes five class sessions, each lasting three hours. Classes meet twice a week during the first two weeks and once during the third week. Our full-weekend retreat, held at a remote location on May 16 - 17, 2026 is a facilitated t-group format. [This year we are holding the retreat at 1440 Multiversity, a retreat center in Scotts Valley. Please look at the FAQ document for more information about this location]. During the fourth class session, T-groups will be introduced in preparation for the retreat. This is a highly experiential course where learning depends on the active engagement of each participant. By enrolling, you are making a clear commitment to participate fully. The course is designed to enhance both self-awareness and interpersonal effectiveness and can be emotionally challenging at times. Important Note: This course is not a substitute for therapy. If you are currently in therapy, we strongly recommend discussing your participation with your therapist before enrolling. COURSE COMPARISON (OB375 vs. OB374): Note: you are eligible to take only one of these two versions.

      "description": "The neoliberal orthodoxy that corporate managers' sole duty is to maximize shareholders' financial value (shareholder primacy) has never been entirely adhered to in practice and has been increasingly challenged in recent decades. While acknowledging the importance of shareholder value, commentators have argued that corporations should purposively benefit other stakeholders, including customers, employees, and the communities they affect (stakeholderism). At the same time, there has been an upswing of investments aligned with investors' social interests, including public equity investments in companies with high environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and private equity 'impact investments' that typically incur greater risks than pure risk-adjusted market rate investments. This course will consider a variety of legal, ethical, and policy issues related to corporations' purposes and responsibilities, including: the meanings and measures of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ESG criteria; disclosure of a company's environmental and social harms or risks; when is it legally and ethically appropriate for corporate managers or institutional investors to compromise shareholder value in the pursuit of social, environmental and other non-pecuniary goals; constituency statutes and benefit corporations that reflect interests other than profit maximization; the power of investors to influence corporate behavior through affirmative investments, divestments and shareholder activism; the power of various stakeholder groups to influence corporate behavior; proposals for broadening the purpose of corporations; barriers to these various practices and proposals; and whether they can be accommodated within a neoliberal framework or require a new framework."

      "department": "SBGID",
      "description": "Here's our current climate conundrum: The climate crisis is the single biggest challenge facing the planet, yet the world is struggling to both regulate and incentivize the global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This challenge has intensified as political polarization creates a stark divide in climate governance, yet in many ways the momentum of the energy transition and climate innovation has not slowed. This course offers an in-depth look at how diverse levers, from carbon markets to legislative and regulatory mandates to grassroots movements, are accelerating the adoption of climate solutions - amid significant national political headwinds. The course begins with the origins of international carbon targets in the Kyoto and Paris Agreements. We explore how both regulated and voluntary carbon markets offer carbon pricing as a means of offsetting risk and meeting net zero goals. Major international compliance systems, beginning with the European Union Emissions Trading System, California's market, China's national ETS and new trade policies such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms are helping to establish a global carbon price. We also study voluntary carbon markets as they finance technological advancement and provide capital flows to those on the front line of climate adaptation. A second major focus is how climate movements have fundamentally shaped policy landscapes and market dynamics. We analyze the evolution from early environmental activism to today's diverse climate movement ecosystem, including youth-led movements, indigenous rights advocacy, environmental justice organizations, and climate litigation strategies. The course examines the role of climate activism in shaping international negotiations, and how grassroots movements pressure both governments and corporations to accelerate climate action. Case studies include the global fossil fuel divestment movement, international pipeline protests, and coordinated campaigns targeting major emitters. We evaluate the critical roles of investors, organized labor, consumers, and grassroots movements in driving climate action across different political contexts. Finally, we look at how technology is enabling decarbonization mechanisms, as carbon pricing drives nature-based and engineered carbon removal solutions. Even as the energy transition is challenged by growing demand for power, there is global resilience to policy changes, with renewable energy costs continuing to decline and private investment flows despite policy uncertainty. The course analyzes how climate policy fragmentation could affect US competitiveness in clean energy markets, examining how other nations advance while US federal policy retreats, and how trade policies based on carbon intensity create supply chain pressures regardless of domestic political positions. Students will understand real-time market developments, assess how climate movements influence business strategy and investment decisions, and evaluate the effectiveness of different advocacy approaches. The course will be taught from the perspective of long-time practitioners and will include visiting founders whose business models are influenced by carbon pricing mechanisms, with emphasis on international and emerging markets. Additional visitors will include policy makers shaped by grassroots pressure, and climate movement leaders driving systemic change."

These players all work within the public institutions that determine the \"rules of the game\" for market activity. The goal of the course is to build a deeper understanding of, and appreciation for, what goes on beyond the market, and to develop tools and frameworks with which to analyze the situation and build integrated strategies.

Students without the necessary familiarity with these techniques are welcome to take the course, but should expect to have to fill the gaps on their own (and with the help of their classmates!). Given the target audience above, the course has three main objectives. 1) To introduce and investigate both classic and new economic issues at the frontier of current research in international finance and macroeconomics. The purely pedagogical part of the course aims to make students familiar with the questions, the current state of research, and the empirical tools currently being used. 2) To create a mental framework and intuitive understanding of important and active questions. What makes a question interesting? What makes a paper a good paper? How to develop a reasoned view of new (and perhaps yet un-studied) issues in international finance and macroeconomics? This objective is less direct and less formal, but aims to transition the students into full-time researchers. 3) To kick-start students on independent research.

This course will review when and how machine learning methods can be used for causal inference, and it will also review recent modifications and extensions to standard methods to adapt them to causal inference and provide statistical theory for hypothesis testing. We consider causal inference methods based on randomized experiments as well as observational studies, including methods such as instrumental variables and those based on longitudinal data. We consider the estimation of average treatment effects as well as personalized policies. Lectures will focus on theoretical developments, while classwork will consist primarily of empirical applications of the methods.

      "department": "RAMGT",
      "description": "The premise of this course is the success of a startup (and even a large company launching a new product) is most dependent on finding a market that is desperate for its product. Focusing on product/market fit conflicts with the conventional view that a startup's limited resources should be applied to perfecting the execution of day to day activities. Interestingly almost every successful product driven technology company followed a similar path to find its product/market fit, but it was usually by accident. In this course we attempt to define the consistent process each successful company pursued, which in most cases is highly counterintuitive, and how to apply it to different situations. Our class highlights the potential conflict between pursuing a conventional approach and optimizing product/market fit. In order to really bring out this conflict, we employ a seminar format with only 25 students so every issue can be evaluated in detail. Our lessons are limited to information technology-based companies, but we have been told they may be more broadly applicable. That being said, this course has been designed for someone who is truly interested in technology-based entrepreneurship. Students who choose to take this course must be committed to read all the assigned articles and books to have the proper foundation to address the frequent counterintuitive learnings. In some cases that might require an entire (although relatively short) book be read for an individual class. A written assignment addressing at least one of the learnings from each reading will be required to be submitted at least four hours prior to each class. Failure to submit even one of the written assignments will result in a U. In addition to the daily written assignments, there will be a large individual project required at the end of the course. In other words, this course requires far more commitment than a typical GSB course, especially for one that offers only two credits. However I promise this course will be invaluable should you choose an operating or investment career in the technology business."

      "description": "Poverty rates have fallen markedly in countries around the world, as more households have joined the lower middle-class. Indeed, though U.S. income inequality has increased, inequality has fallen around the world. However, by developed country standards, poverty remains pervasive. What has caused the decline in rates of poverty and can we expect further decreases or can we act to accelerate the improvements? One answer is that countries that have experienced 'inclusive growth'?, in which the growth of the economy (i.e., GDP) has elevated the incomes of the poor, have done better at creating jobs for the poor, especially in the private sector. Therefore, the class will consider the evidence on the factors that have contributed to inclusive economic growth in developing countries. A second answer as to why poverty has fallen, but remains at high levels, is that governments and aid agencies and foundations have targeted programs to the poor. This course discusses macroeconomic policy, targeted government policies, aid, and entrepreneurship in developing countries. Examples will be given from Latin America, South Asia, and Africa. The course is co-taught by a Stanford economist and a World Bank consultant and will build on examples from recent experiences.

Students will learn from the instructors, course peers, and class visitors, particularly top current search entrepreneurs, CEOs, and investors. This course is designed to assist students who are seriously pursuing a search fund. Those who have taken Entrepreneurial Acquisition (S543) or researched search funds extensively, including holding discussions with current searchers, investors, and CEO's, will benefit the most from this advanced, experiential course. By the end of the course, students will be prepared to or will already have raised search capital and launched their search, if they choose to do so. The course is not a good fit for students who do not know the basics of search funds (such as from taking S543) or are not likely to pursue a search fund upon or within a few years of graduation. Pursuing self-developed work plans that target the aspects of the search fund path most relevant to them at the time of the course, students will target industry segments and business models, evaluate investors, structure their search entity, set up their search process and outreach materials, perhaps begin to contact business owners, and develop wisdom about what makes a deal attractive or unattractive, among other experiences. Students will hear from class guests, including current searchers, standing CEO's of search-acquired companies, active investors, and former searchers (some of whom \"failed\" at buying a company) in order to inform their various decisions as they pursue a search fund. Each student will receive feedback on how they can be a more effective search fund entrepreneur. Teams of two are fine but not necessary. Most students join the class as individuals and all will be graded individually.This course is offered by the Graduate School of Business. It builds on the processes taught in Entrepreneurial Acquisition (S543) and detailed in the Stanford Primer on Search Funds (2020). The course provides a supportive yet challenging environment that will help students step outside of their comfort zone and accelerate learning. By the end of the course each will be better prepared to launch a search than many of the searchers who have come before."

Most companies are not started by MBAs; most startups are not funded by VCs; most employees don't work for tech firms; and most firms don't sell out to other businesses or go public. Rather, the vast majority of companies world-wide are started, funded, owned, and governed by families, and these firms create most of the employment in the global economy. Despite the prominence of family firms, most MBA courses focus on the widely-held or Silicon Valley model of the firm. This course explores the challenges and opportunities faced by family businesses. It is co-taught by Leo Linbeck III, Lecturer since 2005 at the GSB and President and CEO of Aquinas Companies, LLC, and Thomas Brenninkmeijer, a leader in his family business of Cofra Holdings AG. This course is an outlier in a world obsessed with tech startups and venture capital; it is a \"Minority Report\" from the heart of Silicon Valley. The course is intended for four main audiences: (1) Students whose family owns a business. (2) Students who are considering working for a family firm. (3) Students who are interested in acquiring or consulting with a private firm either directly (search funds, management consultants, etc) or indirectly (private equity, etc). (4) Students who are sick of only learning about cool, sexy startups and the geniuses who get rich from them. The course uses a combination of case studies, guest speakers, lectures, movies, projects, and reflections to explore the central ideas of the course, which are likely to appear irrelevant to everyone (save the instructors) but are intended to be informative and entertaining.

In this seminar we will analyze a set of issues that in various ways illustrate the types of problems that can interfere with quality decisions. The emphasis will be on: a) developing reasoned positions; b) making sound and compelling arguments that support those positions, c) learning and updating based on the sound and compelling arguments made by others and d) recognizing errors in reasoning made by self and others. The class will consist of a series of cases that require making a business decision. Students will work together to formulate reasoned arguments supporting their solution. The course grade will be jointly determined by how well students initially analyze the problem and how they then update their solutions based on the arguments made by others.

At its best, AI can help humans mitigate climate change, diagnose and treat diseases more effectively, enhance learning, and improve access to capital throughout the world. But it also has the potential to exacerbate human biases, destroy trust in information flow, displace entire industries, and amplify inequality throughout the world. We have arrived at a pivotal moment in the development of the technology in which we must establish a foundation for how we will design AI to capture the positive potential and mitigate the negative risks. To do this, we must be intentional about human-centered design because, 'Only once we have thought hard about what sort of future we want, will we be able to begin steering a course toward a desirable future. If we don't know what we want, we're unlikely to get it.' Thus, building AI must be an inclusive, interactive, and introspective process guided by an affirmative vision of a beneficial AI-future. The goal of this interdisciplinary class is to bridge the gap between technological and societal objectives: How do we design AI to promote human well-being? The ultimate aim is to provide tools and frameworks to build a more harmonious human society based on cooperation toward a shared vision. Thus, students are trained in basic science to understand what brings about the conditions for human flourishing and will create meaningful AI technologies that aligns with the PACE framework:\u00b7has a clear and meaningful purpose -augments human dignity and autonomy -creates a feeling of inclusivity and collaboration -creates shared prosperity and a sense of forward movement (excellence)Toward this end, students work in interdisciplinary teams on a final project and propose a solution that tackles a significant societal challenge by leveraging technology and frameworks on human thriving."

Do you want the skills to interpret their disclosures, to understand how companies manage their carbon emissions and fulfill their social responsibilities? If so, this course can guide you through the nuances of corporate impact reporting. The course takes an interactive approach to deepen your understanding of how corporations communicate their environmental and social impacts. Class sessions will include exercises with classmates, group conversations, and discussions with influential guest speakers who are leading the charge in corporate measurement and reporting. We will explore various frameworks for measurement, evaluation, risk assessment, and disclosure, shedding light on the motivations behind corporate engagement in environmental and social activities and disclosure, and the responsibilities of managers and directors. We will also delve into understanding the landscape of key players influencing corporate disclosure decisions, from corporate management to citizens and activists to institutional investors and regulatory bodies such as the US Securities Exchange Commission, the International Sustainability Standards Board, and the European Union. Gain the ability to read ESG reports critically, along with a foundational understanding of financial reports. No prior accounting knowledge is necessary, as we will provide essential basics in the initial sessions. The course culminates in group projects that offer an in-depth exploration of issues related to assessing an organization's social and environmental footprint. Project topics may include evaluating sustainability disclosures, analyzing standard-setting and disclosure regulation, or generating and evaluating innovative business models for positive environmental and social impacts.

      "description": "This class is for students who want start or work at an impact venture, or to invest in or grant to such an enterprise. The class deals with situations from the perspective of the entrepreneur/manager, and the funder. Students will: - Learn to evaluate impact and business opportunities in social enterprises, Understand the potential tension between impact and revenue/profit in impact enterprises and how to manage it, Start, grow, and manage a team and a board of directors for a social enterprise, Become versed in the landscape of impact funders, Explore different paths to scaling impact, including those outside of simply growing the venture, Be introduced to how entrepreneurs create social change, Be exposed to the personal journeys and careers of impact entrepreneurs. For purposes of this course an impact venture is 'an organization whose mission is to provide a sustainable solution to a social problem.' The focus on mission makes impact enterprises different in kind from commercial enterprises. That said, it is the instructors' views that, in most ways, impact ventures should be treated and managed like commercial ventures, and this course reflects this perspective. Even so, there are some important differences which are critical to understand to effectively launch, manage or fund an impact enterprise. We will highlight these throughout our sessions. All the cases and class discussions will be exclusively about enterprises and organizations in the impact venture space, some for-profit, and some non-profit, but all run more or less like commercial businesses, e.g., the enterprise focus is on delivering solutions for 'customers' or 'recipients' to solve a social problem, create value and generating revenue (and/or profit). Impact: From Idea to Enterprise is integrative and will allow students to apply many facets of their business school education. We will have a mixture of case discussions, lectures, student-led exercises, panel discussions, and guest speakers. The final project involves engagement with a current impact venture and its management. The instructors, Laura Hattendorf and Russell Siegelman, are both Lecturers in Management at GSB with practical experience in the startup and impact venture space."

      "department": "SBGEN",
      "description": "This year -- 2026 -- will be a fascinating backdrop for national as well as state and local politics. Implications of the current polarized electorate, the economic climate and an uneven but recovering economy, Inflation fears, wars in Ukraine and Gaza will continue to complicate the political landscape. At the apex of political interest will be the American Presidential and Congressional elections. Politics, perhaps like no other arena, provides a rich and dramatic laboratory for studying the art and science of influential communication. Whether it is a local school bond election or a Congressional race, a Presidential debate or a State of the Union Address, the demanding communications of politics provide insights into our own strengths and gaps as communicators and leaders. Political campaigns, by their very nature, are highly visible, oriented toward very specific objectives, and increasingly leverage a variety of new media platforms. They are often emotionally charged, and rife with conflict and drama. The principles foundational to political communications transcend politics, and are useful guides for leaders in business, the non-profit community, as well as government. How candidates, elected officials, and leaders in all kinds of organizations communicate vision, values, and experience, as well as how they perform in very fluid environments, not the least of which may be during a crisis, has a great deal to do with their career success. In its 16th year, this highly interactive course allows students to explore both theory and practice behind effective positioning and presentation. Students will analyze and evaluate both successful and unsuccessful communications strategies of political campaigns and candidates. History is an impactful learning tool, something emphasized throughout the class. As such, students will explore historic examples of US Presidential debates, from Nixon/Kennedy to the present, as well other political events from the near and distant past. Popular culture, the effect of social media, disinformation will also be topics of discussion. Students will experience discussion of political events as they happen -- with each class drawing lessons from political developments around the nation and the world. Students will also hone their own strategic communications skills in activities requiring both written and spoken communication. This is not a course in political science, American government, or in public speaking. However, the engaged student will gain insights into those areas as well. The course is taught by David Demarest, former Vice President of Public Affairs for Stanford University. Demarest has broad communications experience across the public and private sector in financial services, education, and government. Typically, Prof. Demarest shares many of his experiences -- some successful, some less so -- through storytelling, and while those stories may be entertaining, they also provide real-life examples of communications challenges and strategies, After serving as Assistant U.S. Trade Representative, and Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Reagan Administration, in 1988 he served as Communications Director for Vice President George H. W. Bush's successful presidential campaign. He then became a member of the White House senior staff as White House Communications Director. After leaving government in 1993, he spent the next decade leading communications for two Fortune 50 companies, before coming to Stanford in 2005 to head the university's public affairs efforts."

      "department": "SBGEN",
      "description": "Licensing of technology and its corresponding intellectual property is big business, and integral to the business plans and competitive strategies of start-ups and Fortune 500 companies alike. Because licenses are complex agreements with important legal consequences, it is tempting for business executives to delegate to lawyers the negotiation of the 'non-economic terms' of their companies' technology license agreements. The problem with such an approach, however, is that at their core, issues of license structure, scope and risk require business judgments, and not merely legal ones. Do we need exclusive rights, and if so, to what, where and for how long? Will this prospective licensee bring our technology to market, and how do we mitigate the risk that it fails to do so? Can this licensor support our development efforts, and will it stand behind its IP in the event of a problem? Do we expose the guts of our technology to the world and try to protect it with patents, or do we keep it close and rely upon trade secrets? While counsel can offer advice on all these questions, they cannot know your business and competitive environment as you do, or be relied upon to optimize business trade-offs that must align not just with your company's present markets and strategies, but with those you expect it to pursue in the future. This course is organized around two hypothetical companies seeking to negotiate a technology license agreement. Divided into teams representing one or the other of these companies, students collaborate over multiple sessions to develop a strategic business approach and then to negotiate the critical terms of a licensing agreement. Lectures are focused on the business, and to a lesser extent, legal issues arising in complex licensing arrangements, and are designed to give students the context and perspective they need to participate effectively in licensing strategy development and negotiation. By immersing teams of business students in a multi-session licensing negotiation, it is the objective of this course to enable them to better understand and more effectively navigate the strategic business issues that arise in the conceptualization and negotiation of technology license agreements."

I have catalogued the research in strategic management by topic, although I encourage you to think of how the different works we will survey may be influenced by different theoretical perspectives. The main objective of the course is to give you the tools you need to understand research in the field of strategy and contribute to it. Hence, while an insightful critique is always welcome, I will encourage you to take a constructive approach to the work at hand and think of possible extensions of it.

We will look at the media landscape and methods of creating films, television programing, and other creative endeavors that are artistically meaningful and/or have the potential for commercial success. Change is at the heart of the entertainment business. This is a time when existing formulas in the industry are being reconsidered, retooled, or jettisoned - streaming services have changed long-existing creative and financial models; video games constitute a very significant part of the entertainment equation; Silicon Valley-based companies have enormous power across entertainment; international programming and markets increasingly drives creative content; AI has made its mark and its effect will continue to grow; and so on. The entertainment industry is one of enormous importance, both from a business and cultural standpoint, and has influence in virtually every sphere of our society. The seminar will cover the entertainment industry's current state and where it may be heading. Sometimes the industry can seem baffling, mercurial, and characterized more by madness than method. But despite its uncertainties, Hollywood does have its own rules, rhythms, and strategies - and examining and evaluating them will be covered in this course. The seminar will also look at the crucial and evolving relationship between Silicon Valley and Hollywood that is a major component in creating the future of entertainment. The use of the media in the social sphere will also be part of the course. Fundamentally, this is a business, and those providing funding do so hoping for healthy profits, but because of the size of the megaphone the industry possesses, there is tremendous opportunity to use this soft power for social good. Films and television series can reach audiences of staggering sizes and have moved the needle on a wide array of social issues. We will also cover the social changes occurring in the industry, and the importance of leaders creating workplaces and entertainment product that is ethical and inclusive. The course will also cover key elements of film and TV storytelling, and best practices for managing creatives in the industry. I will also bring some of my professional experiences into the classroom (including directing, writing, and producing for film and television, etc.), and discuss them in the context of navigating the business and creative sides of the industry."

Taxes also affect a wide variety of business decisions, including the efficient formation of businesses, operational planning across jurisdictions with competing tax regimes, M&A tax structure, the creation of cash and equity compensation plans, and retirement planning (to name a few). This course first provides a conceptual framework for incorporating taxation into business decisions, linking concepts from accounting, corporate finance, business law, and economics. The course then provides real-world examples to illustrate the impact of tax considerations on earnings and cash flows. The goal of this course is to provide a foundational understanding of tax consequences and trade-offs that can be adapted across jurisdictions and as tax laws change."

      "description": "Continuous-time methods can, in many cases, lead to more powerful models to understand economic phenomena. The Black-Scholes option-pricing formula is significantly more tractable than discrete- time methods of option pricing based on binomial trees. There is an established tradition in continuous-time asset pricing, and there is increasing use of these methods in other fields, such as game theory, contract theory, market microstructure and macroeconomics. The goal of this class is to explore some of the old classic research as well as new economic models, and to discover areas of economics where continuous-time methods can help. The intention is to give graduate students a tool, which they can use to gain comparative advantage in their research, when they see appropriate. With this goal in mind, 25% of the class will focus on mathematics, but with economically relevant examples to illustrate the mathematical results. Up to one half of the class will cover established models, and the rest will focus on new papers. If students have their own work that uses continuous time, we can take a look at that as well. Coursework will include biweekly problem sets and a short final research project. There will also be room for short student presentations (related to homework assignments, economic papers, or definitions and results related to specific math concepts)."

From high-stakes patent battles in 5G and biotech to billion-dollar IP-driven acquisitions, companies across industries are leveraging their IP portfolios to shape markets and outpace competitors. However, many key IP decisions are often made by lawyers without meaningful input from business leaders. This course empowers executives, entrepreneurs, and decision-makers with the tools to actively manage and monetize IP assets. Through case studies, strategic frameworks, and real-world applications, participants will learn how to evaluate, protect, and commercialize IP to drive business success. Whether navigating IP licensing, investment strategies, or technology partnerships, this course provides the insights needed to transform intellectual property into a strategic advantage. Through a combination of case studies (including a group strategy project), analysis of current events, academic literature, class discussion, and guest speakers, we will cover a variety of issues shaping a successful IP strategy in today's global business environment. Topics covered include: - Creating a corporate IP position; - Understanding the forces shaping the global IP marketplace; - IP ownership challenges in the age of AI; - Using big data analytics in making IP decisions; - IP strategy for startups and investors; - Managing corporate IP risk; - IP monetization business models (e.g., licensing, sale, enforcement, spin-offs); - IP valuation and current trends in pricing; - IP considerations in Mergers & Acquisitions; - Trademark & Brand management; - Copyright licensing (open source, content licensing) - Managing data & emerging digital assets (e.g., NFTs, Blockchain tokens)"

      "description": "This seminar provides students with practical solutions to some of the challenges faced in family business transitions. Family businesses are by far the dominant form of commerce world-wide, albeit the majority are small \"mom and pop shops.\" Some research shows that large businesses, whatever the form of ownership, have an average lifespan of around forty years, while small businesses (at least in Japan and Europe) average around twelve years. So, if businesses in general do not survive, then it is a wonder that any family business can survive from one generation to another, let alone two, three, four or more. There are three essential requirements to succeed in a family business transition. First, it may seem obvious that the business must succeed, but it is less obvious what advantages a family business has over its non-family-owned counterparts. Second, the ownership structure must effectively maintain family cohesion and support the business. Finally, family members need to organize in thoughtful ways to work effectively with one another. The beauty of a family business is that it can be more profitable than companies with non-family ownership. Two fundamentals, at least, provide this advantage - a strong value system and a long-term economic perspective. The operative word above, however, is \"can\"; it is by no means a foregone conclusion that a family business will be more successful. Families must thoughtfully develop their advantages, while at the same time avoiding the pitfalls that are inherent in any family business. Accordingly, this course is offered for students whose families own a family business or who are interested in the special challenges faced by family businesses. International students are encouraged to register as different cultural perspectives to family business will enrich the experience for everyone. Particular focus will be given to the transitions from one generation to another and the lessons learned that can be applied during the entire life of the business."

Importantly, this is confronting leaders who have never seen inflation, high interest rates or extended bad business cycles. This course explores how leaders at the world's leading companies are driving frame-breaking transformational change inside of organizations. In addition, in the emerging post-pandemic world, the issues facing leaders across multiple industries require insights on how to drive technological, cultural and ecosystem changes under unprecedented duress. The macro trends that are currently dominating the business world include the need for leaders to understand the best attributes of companies that have both digital and physical roots, as well as how to balance these macro issues in times of great uncertainty. Leaders need to make choices on where to deploy resources, those parts of the technical stack where they will seek to own technology (and where they will partner), and how they can influence, organize, and shape their ecosystems."

      "department": "SBGEN",
      "description": "This course addresses the distinctive challenges and opportunities of launching high-potential new ventures in developing economies. Developing economies are attractive targets for entrepreneurs because many are just starting to move up the growth curve, and they offer low-cost operating environments that can be great development labs for potentially disruptive innovations. They increase in attractiveness when their political institutions stabilize and they become more market-friendly. At the same time, developing economies pose serious challenges. Pioneering entrepreneurs take on significant risks to gain early mover advantages. Specifically, entrepreneurs will not be able to count on the same kind of supportive operating environments that we take for granted in the developed world. They often face cumbersome permit and licensing processes, poorly developed financial and labor markets, problematic import and export procedures, unreliable local supply chains, weak infrastructure, corruption, currency risks, limited investment capital, lack of financial exits and more. This course is designed to help would-be entrepreneurs - both founders and members of entrepreneurial teams - better understand and prepare for these issues as they pursue the opportunities and address the challenges to start, grow, and harvest their ventures in these environments. GSB534 uses a team-based project to learn about and develop solutions to the key challenges described above and potential solutions. A framework based on the recently published World Economic Forum (WEF) report on \"Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Around the Globe and Company Growth Dynamics\" will be used to structure the course along with a few lectures and guests who describe their own startup and investing experiences in developing economies and answer questions. The team-based projects are based on students' ideas; classmates will form teams of their choosing to explore a specific country and investigate an idea's viability. Students must come in willing to be team players and do the work necessary to complete this exercise over the full quarter. Teams of AT LEAST 3 STUDENTS EACH will be formed before the start of class or on the first day of class at the latest so students can decide if they want to enroll. The team will describe, in a final presentation, the challenges and opportunities in their country using the WEF framework. The final presentation will also include the team's thoughts on the viability of their proposed venture and how it capitalizes on their country's assets and addresses its challenges. A detailed business plan is not required; however, specific recommendations and plans for next steps that would be carried out during a 3 to 6-month field and market research study in the country will be part of the final presentation. Students who would prefer to learn more about this subject in a lecture/case discussion format should also enroll in GSB514, offered in Winter term."

At some level, all leadership right now is crisis leadership - getting one's team and organization through unprecedented times. Sometimes the ability to lead through these changes is due to talent; other times, luck plays the more important role. Technological and political changes are upending assumptions and conventional wisdoms that have guided the world for decades. Tomorrow's business leaders need to navigate multiple dimensions and horizons in order to guide their organizations to success: they need to excel in strategy and execution, understanding details and context, navigating digital and physical, and many other dualities. This course explores how leaders at the world's leading companies are driving frame-breaking transformational change inside of organizations that have grown up with a physical foundation, or who have a digital foundation and are moving into the physical domain as a new entrant. The issues facing business leaders across multiple industries require insights on how to drive technological, cultural and ecosystem changes under unprecedented duress. The changes brought about by these dynamics require the development of new types of leaders which we call Systems Leaders. These people seek to maximize and thrive in the chaos of the times. Systems Leaders are adept at systems thinking - in having the ability to analyze the complexity in markets and organizations by paying attention to how the component parts interrelate to each other. The course will delve into the need for systems thinking at multiple levels - of products, organizations, cultures and individuals. By systems thinking we mean having a thorough understanding of how customer success is optimized by knowing how all of the elements of an organization work with both internal and external constituents.

Some students feel they have outgrown their position or business, or they feel drawn to a new area that better suits their values and interests, where they can make a greater contribution. Some students have no idea what they want to do after graduating, they just know they want to make a purposeful change. And finally, some students want to strategically change their direction for reputation reasons. The average U.S. employee tenure is only 4-5 years and job roles often change dramatically within that timeframe. Pivoting is an intentional, methodical process for nimbly navigating career changes. A recent Gallup study revealed that almost 90% of workers are either 'not engaged' or 'actively disengaged' from their jobs. A pivot is a change made of your own volition when you have reached a point in your career when you are ready for increased challenge and impact. Strategic Pivoting is a course specifically developed for any student who already plans to pivot in their career and wants to figure out how to successfully build and create their next chapter. In this course we will discuss four stages for how to best pivot: 1) Planting, how to assess and set a strong foundation of values, strengths and interests. 2) Scanning, researching new and related skills, talking to others, and mapping potential opportunities. 3) Piloting, students conduct small, low-risk experiments to test their new direction, as well as gather real-time data and feedback. And 4) Launching, pulling the trigger, fully committed, to your carefully plotted pivot. The ultimate pay-off to Strategic Pivoting is acknowledging and adapting to a rapidly changing society when it comes to career paths. Because our careers are so fundamentally tied to our livelihood and sense of confidence, purpose and meaning, changes can be traumatic without a road map for traversing them. \"Navigating this accelerated pace of change and this transitional career state, and learning to embrace it instead of resisting it, can become an edge and advantage.\" Alex Rodriguez, Major League Baseball icon, ABC/Fox Sports/ESPN commentator, entrepreneur, and CEO of A-Rod Corp will be a featured Guest Speaker in this course.

The premise of the course is that traditional methods of management may produce adequate levels of performance but prevent excellence from developing. New approaches to leadership will be presented that are more likely to lead to a truly high-performing system. Time will be spent discussing the components of effective leadership, what a manager can do to build a compelling vision, strong teams, and mutual influence sideways and upwards as well as with direct reports. Also, what members can do to support the leader who wants to initiate such changes. Students will meet in a Skill Development Group to apply the course material to their own personal development. The expectation is full attendance at all SDG meetings. Only one excused absence. Attendance is required in EIS Simulation and the Consulting Project classes."

Knowing how to handle these situations is a critical skill in business. Financial restructuring is the process by which distressed companies, and their key stakeholders, use in-court and out-of-court tools and methods to renegotiate their key contracts for the purpose of rehabilitation. In contrast with operational restructuring, financial restructuring focuses on resolving problems on the 'right-hand side' of a company's balance sheet - its debt and non-debt liabilities. This course provides an intensive overview of financial restructuring techniques and processes from the perspectives of distressed firms and their key stakeholders. It is intended for those who plan careers in general management, private equity, entrepreneurship, credit and special situations investing, commercial and investment banking, turnaround management, or financial advisory services. While it is primarily a finance course, it incorporates interdisciplinary elements including negotiations, game theory, strategy, and business law.

Whether you are a manager, director, CEO, a start-up founder, or even undecided, you will absolutely benefit from this class. Assignments include a Personal Reputation Analysis Project, the PRAP, where you will come with an hypothesis about your reputation, then test it by sending out an anonymous survey to friends and colleagues to gather feedback on what you are doing well, and possibly identify blind spots. Next is the RESD, a Reputation Exploration Slide Doc of a leader, company or current reputation situation (national or international). Using frameworks taught in class, you will analyze a reputation and come up with recommendations for that entity to move forward successfully with their reputation improved, fixed or intact. And finally, a personal reflection paper. We will have dynamic guests each with a reputation framework, case study, or lesson to help you navigate and anticipate reputation pitfalls.

If you are interested in starting a company or gaining invaluable expertise for career advancement, RDI is a powerful approach. The RDI process was pioneered by Scott Brady, and its origin story is captured well in the ProjectSHED case. It is a curiosity-centric, structured approach to obtaining a complete picture of an industry or space through research and discussions with industry experts. Those who follow the RDI process stand on the shoulders of thought leaders, stakeholders, and experts to uncover patterns, identify gaps, and understand the big, impactful, non-obvious problems of an industry and the current and future opportunities surrounding them. Over the last few years, the framework has been formalized by Scott and Brett Jordan, and over 300 students have followed the process, resulting in numerous companies and impressive career opportunities. The output of this class would also be an excellent input for courses that focus on further fleshing out potential opportunities, such as Startup Garage. Note: Teams generally have better experiences and outcomes with the RDI process than individuals, provided the groups form organically around shared topic interest and compatibility. While students cannot register as teams, we strongly encourage them to form teams before or in the early stages of the course. You are also welcome to collaborate with students outside the class. We have created this RDI Interest Area List to help connect those with similar interests (link below). https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tlOikI8OVtIhUPuYK3svTQxiUf1rxTJvtkuJbpD95gg/edit?gid=0#gid=0"

In this seminar we will explore the reasons for the tension between artistic excellence and economic security,drawing on the experience of performing arts organizations in the United States and in countries(whose governments have adopted quite different policies toward the arts). Using economic concepts and analysis that we develop in the seminar, you will first examine the fundamental reasons for the economic challenges faced by performing arts organizations. In later sessions, we will consider and evaluate alternative solutions to these challenges in the United States and other countries. The seminar may include meetings with managers and/or trustees of arts organizations.By the end of the seminar, you will be able to assess the economic condition of an arts organization, evaluate alternative strategies for its survival, and understand the consequences of alternative government policies toward the arts.During the early part of the course, you will prepare two short papers on topics or questions that I will suggest. Later, you will prepare a longer paper applying concepts learned to one of the performing arts or a particular arts organization that interests you.

We will ask if and how public policy can affect inequality. We will also focus on business's role -- what are the responsibilities of private sector companies, how does inequality affect them, and how should the growth in inequality affect their strategies? We will look at inequality in income, some of its potential sources, and its effects in other areas. Specifically, we will look at education, housing, the social safety net, migration, and the job market. The class will be very interactive and will be based on readings drawn from academic research, case studies, news, and opinion readings. We will also have guest speakers from industry, government, and non-profits. The class will be co-taught by a GSB labor economist and an advisor to policy makers with decades of business experience.LOGISTICAL NOTE: During the week of May 13, the class will not meet during the regular time slots. Instead, there will be a mandatory, all-day class field trip to explore inequality issues in depth and in person on Wednesday, May 15. If you have an academic-related reason you cannot make the trip, we will assign alternative work. However, the trip is required unless you have a conflicting class or academic obligation."

Manifested in different forms, MaxWeight, c-mu rule, EXP3, policy gradient, to name a few, the drift method powers some of the most popular algorithmic paradigms in queueing networks, optimization and machine learning. Using the drift method as a unifying theme, we will explore major developments in these areas to understand what features can explain the method's effectiveness, how we can rigorously evaluate its performance, and what are some of the emerging research topics.We will develop rigorous probabilistic and optimization methodologies for answering these questions, such as Lyapunov stability theory, state-space collapse, and weak convergence. Applications to be covered include dynamic control and scheduling in queueing networks, delay and stability analysis of stochastic networks, stochastic approximation, and online/supervised/reinforcement learning. The course will be primarily taught in a lecture format, along with some guest lectures and student project presentations.Objective: For students to acquire fundamental methodologies that can be applied to pursuing research topics in theoretical or applied areas.Target Audience: The course is intended for PhD students in Business, Engineering and Economics.

Developing economies are attractive targets for entrepreneurs because many are just starting to move up the growth curve, and they offer low-cost operating environments that can be great development labs for potentially disruptive innovations. They increase in attractiveness when their political institutions stabilize and they become more market-friendly. At the same time, developing economies pose serious challenges. Pioneering entrepreneurs take on significant risks to gain early mover advantages. Specifically, entrepreneurs will not be able to count on the same kind of supportive operating environments that we take for granted in the developed world. They often face cumbersome permit and licensing processes, poorly developed financial and labor markets, problematic import and export procedures, unreliable local supply chains, weak infrastructure, corruption, currency risks, limited investment capital, lack of financial exits and more. This course is designed to help would-be entrepreneurs - both founders and members of entrepreneurial teams - better understand and prepare for these issues as they pursue the opportunities and address the challenges to start, grow, and harvest their ventures in these environments. GSBGEN 514 is a seminar/discussion format in which students will read about and discuss the key challenges described above and potential solutions. Guests will describe their own startup and investing experiences in developing economies and answer questions. A framework based on the World Economic Forum (WEF) report on \"Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Around the Globe and Company Growth Dynamics\" will be used to structure the course. Each student will prepare a short write-up as a final assignment on a case chosen from a selection provided by the instructors.

      "description": "This course introduces and operationalizes the Triple Bottom Line framework for measuring and managing sustainable value creation. The framework highlights the balance that needs to be achieved by an organization across three dimensions of sustainability-related performance - environmental stewardship, social impact, and value creation - and provides a powerful lens for both evaluating the firm's current activities and designing a business strategy with sustainability at the core of its value proposition. The first half of the course focuses on developing skills to use financial statement disclosures, sustainability-related reports, and other publicly available and private sources of information to critically evaluate a company's economic performance and financial condition (i.e., the value creation dimension of the Triple Bottom line) and to measure and assess how a company's operations interacts with the environment and society (i.e., the environmental stewardship and social responsibility dimensions of the Triple Bottom Line). The second half of the course will focus on applying the Triple Bottom Line analyses to specific decision contexts, and will examine the measurement issues, trade-offs, and implementation challenges associated with identifying and executing a sustainability-oriented business strategy. The course is structured to develop students' ability to critically assess the sustainability-related performance of an organization and to ultimately translate that understanding into specific recommendations to improve that company along each dimension of sustainability. The perspective taken is that of an executive relying on available financial and non-financial information for performance evaluation, investment analyses, and strategic decision making purposes, yet the concepts and tools can also be applied by investors who need to understand whether or not the organization's activities are sustainable. The capstone to the course is the completion of a comprehensive, real-time analysis of a publicly-traded company using the Triple Bottom Line framework and the development of a set of recommendations for how the organization can improve its sustainability-related performance."

And how do ensure that they are developed, deployed and scaled in a way that is relevant, appropriate and sustainable? Innovators tackling the world's most difficult problems often ignore, misunderstand, and under-invest in the critical business challenges involved in crossing 'the middle of the value chain.' This is innovation's valley of death: product and system adaption and evaluation; evidence generation and design validation; business and partnership planning; formal or informal regulatory approval and registration. How do you design, introduce, and optimize the intervention's uptake before it can be taken to scale by markets, governments or other systems? The class is taught be Steve Davis, Senior Advisor at the Gates Foundation, former CEO of PATH, IDRI, and Corbis, and former director of social innovation at McKinsey & Co. We take an interdisciplinary approach to look at the factors that pull innovation forward, push it from behind, and (often to the world's detriment) block its successful implementation and scaling. First grounding the discussion in research on innovation and social change, we then apply business principles, real world experiences and several important case studies in global health to examine the way good ideas get stuck, and how good ideas can turn into innovation that matters. We focus on root causes for failure, success factors, and business practices and tools to enable millions of lives to be impacted by social innovation. The seminar combines lectures, case studies, visiting practitioners and team projects focused on the business case for scaling specific social innovations. The goal is to help the next generation of social innovation leaders think more about some of the mistakes of the past, lessons for the future, and new ways of approaching old problems, all from a practitioner's point of view."

By the end of this course, you should have a better understanding of the structural and psychological factors that underlie competition and cooperation, bargaining, contracting, social influence, dispute resolution, and other types of social and organizational interactions. To understand how decisions happen, we will use a combination of experiential exercises in class, in-depth discussions of research findings, and student presentations. We will play interactive games in our meetings to understand how various conditions, such as power and uncertainty, influence our decisions. These simulated interactions will provide you with opportunities to develop your behavioral skills, get constructive feedback from other participants, and learn how you come across. So, if you enjoy in-class exercises, you will enjoy our simulations. At the same time, if you enjoy analyzing human behavior and social interactions, you will like the readings and our discussions.

It builds on the explosion of research in cognitive psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and allied fields over the last few decades to provide perspectives on political beliefs and behavior that are not tweaks on theories of complete rationality; they are distinct ideas with their own premises of how humans think, plan, and decide. These premises do not posit that we are irrational. Such claims are wildly off the mark; they cannot explain how we have become the dominant species on this planet. Instead, they describe a clever but computationally constrained primate whose evolution, cultural as well as biological, has produced a characteristic configuration of mental software and external symbol systems (writing, numbers). The representational and computational capacities of this software and these symbol systems, combined with our unusual ability to cooperate with unrelated strangers, has in a remarkably short time produced massive knowledge-intensive political institutions that can deploy nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and can use epidemiology and molecular genetics to combat epidemics. Such achievements warrant explanations. In short, we are boundedly rational, but that's only half the story; we're also really really clever problem-solvers.

This two unit class focuses on the interplay and tension between the main players in the health care field - providers of health care services (individual doctors, group practices, integrated health care systems), payors (insurances companies, employers, consumers, and government), patients, and innovator companies (biopharma, medical device, diagnostics, and health care IT). The course is designed for students with a broad diversity of backgrounds and interests who want to better understand the health care business and system. No prior experience in the health care or medical field is assumed or needed. The focus of the class will be primarily on the US health care system, but there will be limited discussion of non-US systems as well. The course is divided into four modules: - An overview of the US Health Care System and the interplay between payers, providers, innovators, and patients' Provider delivery models, health care information technology, and incentive structures - The relationship between quality, cost, and access - Integrated systems, value-based, and fee for service models - New IT technologies, including electronic data records - The role of information and incentives - Innovator business models and issues - Financing and managing new product development - Clinical trial management and gaining regulatory approval - Marketing, reimbursement, and sales strategies - Business models to drive innovation - Health care system reform and comparisons of the structure of the US Health Care system to that of other countries. The class will be taught primarily from the perspective of a business person operating a company rather than that of a policy maker, academic, or investor. While there will be a few lectures to provide background and frameworks for course topics, most classes will involve a case discussion and prominent guest speakers from the health care industry.

Addressing climate change demands changes in natural, social, and economic systems and will require greater collaboration. In that spirit, this course is being offered by a team of professors from different schools and universities across the globe. Each instructor will deliver one or more lectures and there will be students from a number of different schools. Our teaching group consists of current and former AFA and EFA presidents and some of the leading climate finance scholars, including Laura Starks (current AFA President), Patrick Bolton (former AFA President), Stefano Giglio, Marcin Kacperczyk (former EFA President), Caroline Flammer, Geoff Heal, Stefan Reichelstein, Ben Caldecott and Peter Tufano. Pre-requisites and finance context: The course will assume that participants have a background in core graduate-level finance. The course will cover topics from a variety of subfields in finance (asset pricing, financial intermediation, household finance, corporate finance). The introductory block of three classes is intended to orient students to the science of climate change as well as to refresh key concepts from economics and finance; the remaining classes will dive into detail on current research in different subfield. We will conclude with a discussion of open topics in this field. We expect that the course will be useful to doctoral students in finance, economics, and accounting. As a global class, we will largely be on Zoom.

Topics covered include Monte-Carlo simulation, static optimization, data-driven optimization, and dynamic decision-making. Much like OIT 245/247, the class is taught in an interactive style, with in-class exercises focused on applications drawn from a variety of industry segments (including advertising, healthcare, finance, supply chain management, pricing, energy, scheduling, or risk management). Because this is an advanced version of OIT 245/247, several differences are also worth emphasizing. The first is in the breadth of topics: OIT 248 covers a slightly expanded set of topics compared to OIT 245/247, including a few classes on data-driven optimization and connections to modern machine learning and AI pipelines. The second is the depth and pace of the coverage: each topic in OIT 245/7 is covered at a faster pace and deeper level in OIT 248, and OIT 248 requires some versatility and willingness to absorb mathematical formulas and equations. A third difference is the coding environment: OIT 248 leverages Python instead of Excel for implementation, so some basic experience with coding is expected. No prior coding experience in Python is required, but every student in Advanced is expected to have had some prior formal coding experience in a programming language, e.g., C, Java, Matlab, etc. OIT 248 starts with an introduction to Python, but the express purpose of the class is not to teach Python, but rather to use Python; so the Python coverage will feel very fast-paced to anyone with zero coding background. The last difference is that OIT 248 devotes more time to discussing practical issues that arise in real-world business situations, so the course is a best fit for students interested in career paths involving AI, analytics, and data science."

From the point of view of the entrepreneur, the course considers how significant business opportunities are identified, planned, and built into real companies; how resources are matched with opportunity; and how, within this framework, entrepreneurs seek capital and other assistance from venture capitalists or other sources. From the point of view of the venture capitalist, the course considers how potential entrepreneurial investments are evaluated, valued, structured, and enhanced; how different venture capital strategies are deployed; and how venture capitalists raise and manage their own funds. The course includes a term-long project where students work in teams (4-5 students per team) to write a business plan (or a business model canvas) for a venture of the team's choosing."

A team project on an innovation challenge selected by students will provide a real world experience applying these frameworks. We encourage diverse innovation challenges that could lead to one of the following: a concept for a new venture, a critical evaluation of an existing business model with a recommendation for a change, a critical evaluation of operational processes for an existing organization with recommendations for changes. Students will develop a project proposal as part of OIT280 and they will launch and implement the project in OIT281. In addition, students will examine through a series of case studies how organizations develop operating models that implement innovative business models and integrate operations, innovation and technology. Key Topics: business model analysis and design, design thinking, lean startup, precedent-based innovation, technology readiness level assessment, AI and 3D printing, value chain innovation, innovation process applications."

The perspective taken is that of an outsider relying on publicly-available financial information for investment, credit, and strategic decision-making purposes. The course relies heavily upon financial statement analysis tools and the economic profit-based valuation framework. Through lectures, in-depth case studies, and real-time exercises, the first half of the course covers traditional financial statement analysis-based tools for critically analyzing and assessing a firm's current financial performance and economic condition, including ratio analysis, accounting quality analysis, and financial distress / bankruptcy prediction models. The second half of the course introduces an accounting-based valuation framework and develops the link between financial statement analysis, firm performance, and firm value. The capstone to the course is the completion of a comprehensive, real-time analysis and valuation of a publicly traded firm (or registered IPO candidate). The course is structured for students to gain a deeper understanding of the economic pressures behind the valuation creation and valuation process. The course will be useful to those students who anticipate making investment or credit decisions at least partially based on historical and prospective financial statement information, and those who want to have a better understanding of how to use financial information to assess whether and how any organization is creating value through its operations and strategic actions."

Does our education system have what it takes to produce graduates who are prepared for college, career, and citizenship in our increasingly digital and pluralistic world? Will income and ethnic achievement gaps continue to be pervasive and persistent in our nation's largest urban cities? Will family zip code determine educational destiny for the next generation of students? Which strategies and reforms are truly demonstrating results and which are merely passing fads? As in all large-scale enterprises undergoing rapid, transformative change, leadership matters greatly. Fortunately, over the last decade, the reform of American public education has been led by a number of innovative and results-oriented leaders at the state, district and charter levels. These leaders are bringing additional urgency, strategies, and ideas designed to prepare America's schools and students for the century ahead. Some ideas are proving to be critical levers for change, others are facing significant political challenges, and others have not delivered on expected results. Many of them hold lessons for how future educational leaders can contribute to transforming public education for the next generation of K-12 students. This course will focus on school system leadership for education reform. The course will provide an overview of the critical issues facing K-12 public education in America today, and what is going on across the U.S. during this transformative period of change. Once this context is set, students will study education leaders and systems change strategies from the last 10-15 years at the state, district and charter levels. We will focus on leaders across five domains: Leadership in crisis situations, strategic leadership, 'china-breaking' leadership, sustaining leadership, and next generation leadership. We will also look at leadership examples from outside K-12 education to broaden our thinking about what leadership styles and strategies could be successfully applied to education. Students will debate the strategies and efficacy of how different leaders approached systems-level change and will form their own working hypotheses of what is needed to help transform the American education system. Case studies in school system leadership will form the primary basis for classroom assignments and discussion. We will examine what went right and what went wrong in each case, focusing particularly on the decisions that school system leaders faced and the implications of their decisions. Most cases will be supplemented with research publications, technical notes, news clips, and/or videos to deepen students' understanding of the context or issues discussed in the cases.

Our goal is to have students emerge with a practical and analytical framework for: 1. evaluating impact and mission-aligned investments across multiple asset classes and sectors; 2. constructing a portfolio using impact as a lens; 3. designing an impact investment company; and 4. understanding the many practical and theoretical challenges confronting this exciting emerging field. We start by exploring some fundamental questions: what is a purposeful or impact investment; can impact investments be defined along a spectrum between conventional investing and philanthropy; whose money is it; what are the constraints and opportunities; how do we (re)define return and/or performance. We briefly analyze impact investing in the context of modern portfolio theory. We then develop a framework for portfolio construction and evaluation across four criteria: risk, return, liquidity, and impact. Through a combination of class dialogues, role plays, and case discussions, we will explore a wide variety of asset classes, impact themes, and investment challenges. A series of team-based investment committee simulations will comprise a significant portion of the course and will provide a significant experiential learning experience. Previous experience in finance, investing, social enterprise, entrepreneurship, or philanthropy is not required, but both helpful and welcomed. While first year students are encouraged to enroll, students who have limited familiarity with the basics of investing and corporate finance are strongly encouraged to purchase David Swensen's \"Pioneering Portfolio Management\" and cover the recommended chapters in advance of the course.

      "description": "In addition to having leadership roles in corporations, investment firms, and other organizations, today's MBAs will be tomorrow's university trustees and major donors. They will find many of these institutions in a state of crisis involving identity, equality, and discourse. During the past half century, American universities and the leadership of major corporations have evolved from being largely white, male, and Protestant to becoming more diverse in many ways. However, some of the policies that have contributed to this progress are being abandoned or distorted. For example, the Supreme Court recently prohibited race-based affirmative action, a major vehicle for achieving diversity. And diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, originally designed to counter discrimination based on individuals' identities, have sometimes become vehicles for creating stark divisions among people with different identities. The university's missions of seeking truth and engaging in critical inquiry have been undermined by both progressive and conservative actors. Affective polarization has dramatically increased, and civil and critical discourse are in steep decline throughout society's institutions. Controversies about the war in Gaza have only exacerbated these problems.We will examine the nature and causes of these and related problems, and consider possible solutions for reducing polarization, restoring discourse, and achieving genuine equality. Although our main focus will be on institutions of higher education, we will also examine these issues in corporations and other organizational settings. In the conduct of the class, we will try to model civil, critical discourse.Students who opt to take the course for a grade will write a paper of approximately 10 single-spaced pages on any topic related to the course. Students who opt to take the course on a pass/fail basis will be assessed based on four reflection papers. In both cases, students' performance will also be evaluated based on class participation."

If we aspire to address challenges across social, economic, and political arenas, with highly charged moral implications and multiple stakeholders, we have an imperative to use all available tools by discovering, celebrating, and advancing diversity in leadership.In this course, we will: (1) study a range of effective leadership approaches; (2) develop broad, transportable skills and frameworks required to lead in any complex setting - business, public sector, nonprofit sector; (3) delve into leadership tradeoffs and tensions; (4) explore and understand our own values and tacit and explicit decision-making criteria; and (5) recognize barriers to diversity and tactics to address them. Guiding questions will include: How does the context shape the solution set? What does inspired and inspiring leadership look like? How do race/gender/other identities enter into the equation? How do I develop my own brand of leadership? We will examine contemporary leaders and controversies in education and elsewhere, draw upon timeless historical thinkers, enjoy the wisdom of guest speakers, and work intensively in small groups to highlight challenges, opportunities, and tradeoffs. By exploring a range of approaches and situations, we will strive for deeper understanding of ourselves and of the context to become a more capable, empathetic and effective leaders."

The course material deals with both the transformation of existing organizations to succeed by being more sustainable, and with 'ecopreneurship' - the creation of a new organization aimed at successfully advancing environmental sustainability. The course is built on two very different bodies of research, one dealing with success and the other dealing with sustainability: Regarding success. The course draws on the extensive literature in strategic management and entrepreneurship. This work gives us specific, actionable lessons that you can use when creating and scaling your organization. These lessons increase the chances that your efforts will lead to an organization that spectacularly changes the world. Students interested in generating comfortable, incremental change should not take this course. Those interested in creative destruction - overturning the status quo with radical, innovative transformation - should take the course. Regarding sustainability. The course is informed by the experiences we are seeing among changemakers all over the world, as they tackle humanity's great sustainability problems. These include climate change and the energy transformation, of course, but more broadly also include a wide variety of other issues: biodiversity loss and regeneration, waste and the circular economy, food security and our need for water, human conflict and displacement, environmental justice, our oceans, preservation and conservation, and adaptation and resilience, among other topics. And the organizational forms we consider will also be varied. We will study companies that seek to make money in the capitalist economy by competing on the basis of environmental sustainability. But we will also be looking at non-governmental organizations, social movement organizations, public-sector organizations, and organizations involved in health and education as they also play a central role in the transformation of our economy and society to be more sustainable."

It is especially suited for students with little or no prior experience in private equity. Using a single real-world case study, students will follow the full investment lifecycle of an actual company - from the initial private equity investment through its IPO and eventual exit. Along the way, students will analyze and engage with key aspects of the investment process, including industry dynamics, company evaluation, valuation methodologies, and capital structure decisions. Midway through the course, as part of their midterm evaluation, student teams will present a buyout proposal to an investment committee that includes the company's CEO and its lead private equity investors. The course will also examine how the company navigated unexpected crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the strategic decisions that enabled resilience and value creation. As the company prepares for a public market exit, we will explore the IPO process from both the company's and the public investors\u00bf'perspectives. Throughout the course, industry experts and practitioners will share real-world insights and experiences. In the final class, the CEO and private equity investors will discuss the ten-year journey from buyout to exit and reflect on the key lessons learned. For their final project, each student will select a public company they believe is an attractive acquisition target and present a detailed investment thesis -- including industry outlook, company assessment, valuation, and capital structure recommendations. By the end of the course, students will have developed the skills and confidence to evaluate and execute private equity investments using practical, real-world frameworks. A working knowledge of corporate finance and accounting is required, but prior private equity experience is not.

Yet, as recent events like pandemics, wars or severe (climate-change induced) weather events serve to remind us, such advancements have also led to heightened complexities and management challenges. Correspondingly, supply chain research has transitioned during the past 60+ years from addressing primarily operational questions related to production, inventory, or logistics to examining strategic issues on information sharing or incentive alignment among the many stakeholders involved in today's global supply chains, and to understanding the role of regulation or technology in improving designs and processes. Reflecting these trends, this course sets two main learning objectives. First, to survey some of the foundational tools and techniques used to model and understand supply chains, leveraging ideas from operations research, decision sciences, economics, and computer science. Second, to identify knowledge gaps and research opportunities by covering emerging topics such as supply chain financing, designing and operating socially responsible and environmentally sustainable supply chains, or using technology (AI, online platforms, distributed ledgers, remote sensing) to improve designs and processes.

Using nine cases of both early-stage, entrepreneur-led ventures and later-stage, public or large-cap firms, this course will examine best practices for scaling new enterprises in emerging markets. It will do so primarily through the lens of a potential investor. It will also explore what is required to spark, nurture and scale entire sectors that serve rapidly growing, often low-income markets. What does it mean to work in markets with limited infrastructure? What common mistakes are made - whether in business model design, in supply chains, or in dealing with government - and how can we avoid them? Which are the best business models to serve markets that corporations have traditionally ignored, and in which government has failed to deliver? Who might be threatened by the success of these new businesses? The seminar is a good match for Stanford students interested in working or investing in emerging markets. It will be taught by Matt Bannick, who led Omidyar Network (a $1 billion impact investing fund) and is the former President of eBay International and of PayPal."

In this course we will explore the workings of these interactions and the challenges they present for societies around the globe. As specific examples, we will discuss the 21st century economic and political forces affecting internet governance, global supply chains, and the workings of different legal systems. We will see how the competence and integrity of people and institutions, their respect of human rights, and the structure and effectiveness of governance and accountability mechanisms in the private and the public sectors, are key determinants of the outcomes. At one extreme, people and institutions may be highly effective but lack concern for human rights. At the other extreme, compassionate individuals and institutions might be ineffective or incompetent. It is also a truism that power can corrupt and may be abused. In fact, standard success metrics in business and in government, combined with weak governance mechanisms, may encourage and enable such abuse.

Issues considered include those involving activist and interest groups, the media, legislatures, regulatory and antitrust agencies, and other forms of political risk. In many of the class sessions, we will draw on theoretical and empirical research in political economy, a field that is particularly relevant for understanding relationships between firms and governments, because (unlike most of economics) political economy focuses on interactions that are neither voluntary nor transacted via money."

The course begins by establishing the concepts underlying financial reporting and then focuses on advanced financial reporting topics such as revenue recognition, tax reporting, long-term liabilities such as leasing contracts and bonds, intercompany investments, Mergers and Acquisitions, and Corporate divestitures. The goal of the course is to make students informed issuers or users of financial reporting information. Issuers (firm management) seek to communicate to users (analysts, investors, and creditors) information about the firm's performance and prospects. Users seek to understand the implications of financial statement information for the current and future prospects of the firm. The course focuses on understanding the mapping between underlying economic events and the information in financial statements and on how this mapping affects inferences about the economic activities and financial position of the firm. Because managers seek to communicate to financial statement users through financial statements and developing financial reporting information requires the exercise of considerable judgment, users seek to understand the financial information reported by issuers. The course will be useful for anyone who wants to have a deep knowledge of the implications of relying on the information from financial reports such as investment bankers, restructuring and turnaround specialists, private equity professionals, corporate development/internal M&A professionals and entrepreneurs. This course is also useful for C-level roles (CEO, CFO, SVPs/GMs) and for those who want to serve on boards of major corporations as it provides an executive viewpoint on financial reporting and investor messaging implications for complex transactions."

Upon completion, students will have the theoretical foundations necessary for advanced finance electives. Students should have a background in finance fundamentals and an interest in understanding the theoretical underpinnings of advanced financial concepts and their practical application. The course begins with a comprehensive review of essential concepts, followed by two interconnected modules. The first module examines the determination of optimal capital structure, starting with the Modigliani-Miller Theorem, which establishes the conditions under which project choice and financing can be separated. We then explore why these conditions rarely hold in practice: financing decisions convey information to capital markets, shape managerial incentives, and have tax implications. The module concludes with two valuation methodologies linking financing and valuation: WACC and APV approaches. The second module introduces optionality and its applications to financial and real assets. Students learn to identify and value embedded options in corporate decisions. The course concludes by demonstrating that corporate hedging policies are integral components of capital structure strategy, not independent considerations. The course employs lectures supplemented by case studies that illustrate theoretical concepts in complex, real-world contexts, ensuring students develop both conceptual understanding and practical analytical skills."

We will discuss the mechanics of probability (manipulating some probabilities to get others) and how to use probabilities to make decisions about uncertain events. Statistics allows managers to use small amounts of information to answer big questions. For example, statistics can help predict whether a new product will succeed or what revenue will be next quarter. The third topic, decision analysis, uses probability and statistics to plan actions, such as whether to test a new drug, buy an option, or explore for oil.

This course examines how AI is reshaping power in business, government, and society. Each week we take up a big question about AI and power: How will people and firms actually use AI, and how will this create new kinds of power? Who will ultimately control AI\u00bfs development and deployment? How should companies reinvent their internal governance for AI? Can democracy survive in the age of AI? Will AI make us smarter? Through case discussions, debates, and real-world examples, students will analyze the strategic choices facing firms, policymakers, and citizens as AI becomes fused into society. The goal is to equip future leaders not just to adopt AI, but to understand the political and governance challenges that will determine who wins and who loses in the AI era."

The concept of translation can be cast as the following equation, which will be discussed in the class: Innovation = (Inventiona+ C) \u00d7 Translationb (Where a, b, and C are greater than zero) In light of these challenges, this class will address the following strategic questions and use it to propose a framework for innovation that will increase the probability of successful translation. The class will attempt to address the following questions and extract the principles for enabling translation. 1. What is Translation and why is it necessary? (Examples of Translation from the instructors and visiting lecturers) 2. What does it take for Translation that connects concepts to reality to succeed? 3. What factors prevent Translation from succeeding? 4. What general theoretical framework can we construct to encompass the various types of disruptive innovation?"

To explain key concepts, we draw on robust social science research, which highlights several leadership challenges: making sound decisions, motivating employees to implement your vision, influencing others to support your ideas, and dealing with interpersonal conflict. We explore these issues using readings, cases, lectures, discussions, and in-class exercises. In many ways, this is a course in applied social and behavioral science. By this, we mean that the course will cover a variety of core concepts and theories from psychology and organizational science that will help you diagnose organizational problems and decide on the best course of action. The goal is to apply research-based knowledge to resolve practical dilemmas. This will be accomplished through careful analysis of experiential exercises and discussion of cases involving examples from actual organizations. After taking this course, students will be better able to: (1) craft more compelling communication that encourages others to recognize the value of their ideas, (2) build strong, dynamic, and highly motivated teams, and (3) manage collaboration challenges with a combination of sensitivity and political savvy.

Strategy is at the heart of problem solving and achieving objectives, yet few people can define strategy, much less understand how to conceptualize, design, and execute effective strategies that yield the best outcomes.This course focuses on interesting and engaging case studies, each of which illustrates a key ingredient of strategy. Some are well-known historical events, while others are less obvious, but all have a strategic lesson to share. They are quite diverse, from the planning of a high-risk rescue in the Colorado Rockies, to a product crisis in a Fortune 50 company, to a little-known failed military mission of WWII, to a commercial airline disaster. The ability to think through challenging and varied scenarios is both instructive and mind-stretching. There will be some pre-reading on each case study and there may be a field trip for students to put their lessons into practice. The course is designed to be highly interactive; all to enable students to unravel the mystery and power of strategic thinking. Students will also have the opportunity to select and analyze a case reflecting interests of their own. This course can help students not only prepare for a career in a range of fields, but also as they meet the challenges of their current coursework.

The palette on which the course will anchor on is New Zealand, a country that I have, over the years, developed a deep relationship with. In my mind, New Zealand has always been one of the most innovative and progressive countries in the world, economically, socially and environmentally. This has come from a unique partnership between the government and the private sector, giving rise to several government enabled, private sector led initiatives. Students in this course will work with leaders and entities within New Zealand's primary sector, including key Maori business leaders/entities and the Ministries of Primary Sector and Trade. The projects with deeply integrated interdependencies will feature large-scale challenges that fall in the category of wicked problems. It will involve scaled interventions that will need to simultaneously satisfy economic, social and environmental needs. The course will give students as future leaders with an immersive experience of dealing with highly integrated and holistic solutions that are required to solve the wicked problem of large-scale sustainable transformations. This course is part of the GSB's Action Learning Program, in which you will work on real business challenges under the guidance of faculty. In this intensive project-based course, you will learn research-validated foundations, tools, and practices; apply these tools and learnings to a real project for an external organization; create value for the organization by providing insights and deliverables; and be an ambassador to the organization by exposing them to the talent, values, and expertise of the GSB. You will also have the opportunity to gain practical industry experience and exposure to the organization, its industry, and the space in which it operates; build relationships in the organization and industry; and gain an understanding of related career paths."

For example, an organizational culture emerges through interactions of individuals within the formal and informal social networks of the organization. But once established, such a culture can determine the nature of interactions between individuals. Theories of social capital, influence, power and relational sociology speak to these types of problems; social network analysis provides tools to approach them rigorously. This course will have four modules designed to make you a confident creator and skeptical consumer of social network research. We'll start with definitions and fundamental results from graph theory. We'll then situate social networks within sociological (and adjacent) theory before covering some approaches for (and challenges of) collecting and working with empirical network data. Finally, we'll discuss contemporary research around social networks within organizational contexts and future directions."

In the modern corporation, everything is rented: owners, capital, C-suite, labor, assets, even the legal system. In such a world, it appears pointless to build an institution- a social arrangement that is stable and long-lived, created and maintained to serve a shared purpose that cannot be achieved by individuals acting alone. Indeed, in a world transfixed by the allure of new technology, institutions are viewed as obstacles that must be routed around. Or disrupted. Or destroyed. This course takes a different view: institutions are essential to a well-functioning society. In the commercial world, institutions are what we refer to as enduring enterprises. The course will explore why and how to turn a company into an institution, whether that company is a family firm (the primary form of enduring enterprise), startup, growth business, professional services partnership, or legacy corporation. It is co-taught by Leo Linbeck III, Lecturer since 2005 at the GSB and President and CEO of Aquinas Companies, LLC, and Thomas Brenninkmeijer, a leader in his family business Cofra Holding. The course is intended for three main audiences: (1) Students from a family firm who may or may not want to work at that firm. (2) Students who are interested in building or leading or buying an enduring non-family firm. (3) Students who want to explore a view of business that is markedly different from the 'Silicon Valley model.'

The goal of this course is to improve students' judgment in confronting challenging, real business situations encountered in the normal progression of corporate activities. The course aims to sharpen moral reasoning and build judgment without favoring a particular position. The course will be taught by Mark Leslie and Peter Levine, Lecturers. The course is taught using 'vignettes'. At the beginning of each class students will be given a one-page reading that describes a business situation which requires a decision to be made. After in-depth discussion, a second page will be handed out, describing how the situation actually unfolded and challenges the class with new information. This new information typically changes the dynamics of the case and requires a new decision to be made. Often there is a third and fourth page that continues the dialogue. Frequent student-to-student and student-to-instructor role-playing will be employed in the development of the session. Note that for most classes there is little or no advanced preparation required, which is often the case when making real-world business decisions. Cases are drawn from a wide selection of ACTUAL BUSINESS SITUATIONS with protagonists joining the class as guests whenever available. Vignettes are based on topics such as raising venture capital, managing major industrial customers, product distribution agreements, board of director and fiduciary conflicts, developing financial instruments, palace revolt / mutiny, work/life balance, rape accusation of an executive, etc. The class is extremely engaging - it is quite usual to find continuing discussion of the day's case outside the classroom among small groups of students. This class is for two GSB credits and will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Sixty percent of the final grade will be derived from classroom performance; the remainder will be based on a final written assignment describing a personal ethical situation that the student has faced in their careers."

The course looks at the entire selling process of prospecting, qualification, discovery, understanding value, customizing presentations, objection handling, and closing. This is not a typical GSB case-study-based course. Students who have taken previous versions of this class describe it as a practical, hands-on, skills-based class. Students will work by themselves outside of class to prepare for group exercises and role-plays that will take place in class. These exercises are designed to give students practice with selling fundamentals in each stage of the selling process, and to give them the opportunity to observe and provide feedback to others. Our goal is to provide students the time in class to focus on doing stuff (e.g., practice using curiosity) rather than just thinking about and talking about stuff. After taking this course, you should understand what is involved in all of the following steps of the selling process: Preparing a value-based prospecting script. - Using an advanced questioning methodology and note-taking strategy for discovering a customer's most important business priorities and motivations. - Developing a curiosity-based approach to handling objections in all stages of the selling process. - Creating and delivering effective customized presentations. - Understanding the most effective ways to create engagement and interaction when selling. - Developing a strategy and building the confidence to ask the hard questions when closing a deal. - Using a value-based mutual plan to control the sales cycle and move a deal forward. - Identifying the most valuable categories for qualifying an opportunity. - Accelerating the process of relationship building. Understanding a customer's entire decision making process (DMP). - Discovering limiting beliefs and seeing how they impact your ability to accomplish your objectives. - Applying these fundamentals of effective selling to your personal selling situations with confidence."

At the same time, social movements create organizational structures that help them carry out their goals, reproduce their missions and tactics, and effectively generate collective action. The purpose of this course is to examine the complex relationship between social movements and organizations. In order to understand the empirical link between movements and organizations, we will rely on social movement and organizational theory. Like the phenomena they seek to explain, these theories are strongly intertwined. In this course, we will cover topics related to how movements use organizations to propel change, and topics related to how movements help generate social change by targeting organizations.

Driven in part by policy decisions over the past decade in Washington and Beijing, the world built by the West after World War II is changing. Most American policymakers now label the relationship between the U.S. and China as one of strategic competition. They are often less clear on whether this term applies to the governments, the peoples, the businesses based within each country, or the two nation-states. At the same time, these two superpowers also have shared interests. We seek to understand the changing relationships between the U.S. and China, and what both competition and possible cooperation between their governments mean for others. American business leaders may be caught between two governments with conflicting interests. Business leaders in other countries may be caught among three governments: America, China, and their home-country government. This is a course not about China per se, but instead about the interactions between these two superpowers' governments and policies. We will look at the U.S.-China relationship by unpacking and examining distinct elements, devoting 1 or 2 class sessions on each topic. Relying in part on guests with practical expertise in some element of the U.S.-China relationship, our goals are to understand:* The most significant changes in Chinese policy direction in the Xi era;* Changes among Western leaders' policy approaches as they have realized their 50-year-old policy toward China either was wrong or is now out-of-date;* What the strategic competition label might mean and how it could translate into specific policy changes in both countries;* What opportunities exist for cooperation and mutual benefit despite strategic competition;* How China might try to change the post-WWII international rules and organizations;* How leaders of global businesses, in the U.S., China, and other countries, are caught between these two governments;* What decoupling in certain industries might mean; and* Possible ways to think about these issues as the U.S.-China relationship evolves."

      "department": "RAMGT",
      "description": "From Amazon and Apple Store to Airbnb and Uber, our day-to-day life is surrounded by marketplaces. In this class, we will analyze the economics and strategy of marketplaces. We will consider the forces that have led to the proliferation of these marketplaces, as well as the strategic choices that determine which ones succeed. We will also study the strategy of managing these marketplaces: how should matching work, how marketplace design can solve problems of congestion or market thinness, how to discover prices through auctions, and how to get feedback and design a well-functioning rating system. We will also talk about trust and safety as a key pillar of successful marketplaces. We will also learn how to design non-monetary markets that solve big social problems, such as kidney exchange, food banks, public housing, and school choice. Finally, we will discuss the regulatory challenges of these marketplaces, especially with regard to labor income and platform's monopoly power. Applications include online stores; ride-sharing and transportation; advertising and sponsored search; room-sharing and vacation rentals; creator/passion economy; B2B marketplaces; dating; and labor markets. The class will be in lecture format and will feature several guest speakers, from founders, to investors, to Nobel laureates of market design."

      "course": "OB655: The Psychology of Brokering",
      "department": "OB",
      "description": "This seminar will explore the critical role that different kinds of brokers play in social and organizational networks. Brokers influence other parties' interactions and relationships across numerous contexts, from journalism, music production and trade, to migration, diplomacy, and dealmaking. Brokers transfer information, facilitate collaborations within organizations, and promote exchange between organizations. They spread gossip, shape labor market outcomes, and occasionally instigate conflict. Hence, to understand interactions and relationships in social and organizational contexts, we must understand the dynamics of brokering. We will discuss intrapersonal, interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup processes related to brokering. Topics of discussion will include social influence, trust, and status, among other topics. We will read research from multiple disciplines, including cognitive, personality, and social psychology, sociology, political science, and management. This course is intended for PhD students who wish to think together about theoretical ideas, methodology, and empirical findings related to brokering, and develop research projects in this field."

Both new and existing high technology firms such as Google, Amazon, Stripe, Airbnb and others are reshaping industries as disparate as life sciences and transportation. The management principles, competitive strategies, partnerships, and core competencies of the 20th century are being challenged in a world of bits and the global network in which all companies are forced to compete. In this course we will explore some of the fundamental technological changes impacting these industries, such as scaling assets without owning them, partnerships with digital leaders and new distribution strategies for goods and services. We will hear from executives of both leading Fortune 500 companies and new disruptors about what it takes to survive and thrive in this new digital economy."
