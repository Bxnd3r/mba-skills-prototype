      "department": "Booth",
      "description": "This course provides an introduction to financial statements and the financial reporting process from a user's perspective. The focus of the course is on fundamental accounting concepts and principles. Students learn how the economic transactions of a firm are reported in the financial statements and related disclosures. The objective of the course is to provide students with basic skills necessary to read and analyze financial statements as well as to prepare students for more advanced financial statement analysis courses."

      "description": "We develop your ability to analyze the economic costs of important decisions\u00a0within\u00a0a firm. These decisions include make vs. buy, abandon vs. continue, setting transfer prices, and evaluating employee performance, to name a few. When you leave the course, you will understand key costing concepts such as overhead allocation, activity-based costing, capacity costs, customer profitability, transfer pricing, performance evaluation, and internal controls. We apply a case-based approach to learning. Cases cover both the manufacturing and service sectors. The course is highly recommended for students intending to become management consultants, entrepreneurs, managers (e.g., CEOs, CFOs, product managers), and anyone with an interest in learning how firms make product and service decisions from a cost-analysis perspective"

      "course": "30116: Accounting and Financial Analysis",
      "department": "Booth",
      "description": "This course is designed to improve students\u2019 understanding of financial information beyond an introductory accounting class. It will provide the knowledge of financial statements necessary to conduct a reasonably sophisticated financial statement analysis. The focus is on the use of financial statements, although this requires some understanding of the process by which financial statements are produced. It will benefit students that want to become bankers, investors, analysts, or any other job that requires more than a superficial understanding of financial reporting. The course is also a good replacement for B30000 for MBA students that have already taken an introductory accounting class (the online pre-MBA accounting class is a great preparation for the class)."

      "description": "This course provides students with a framework for thinking about tax planning. This framework has two principal advantages. First, it is designed to have value long after the recent and next tax law change. Second, the framework is portable, in that it can be applied to any set of tax laws - those of the United States or any other country. Although the course generally focuses on U.S. based transactions and planning examples, the underlying ideas are applicable in other jurisdictions. Once developed, the framework is applied to a variety of business settings. The applications integrate concepts from finance, economics, and accounting to achieve a more complete understanding of the role of taxes in business strategy. The course also includes periodic focus on the financial accounting ramifications of tax planning. Moreover, the course content has valuation related implications."

      "description": "In previous accounting/financial analysis courses, you obtained skills important to understanding how a firm tracks its day-to-day operations, how its activities translate into periodic financial statements and how such financial statements may be used to assess the value of a firm. Outside of 'normal' business activities, firms periodically undergo dramatic transformations via acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, or bankruptcy. This course builds on knowledge acquired from other Booth courses and equips you with tools to build financial models to better understand the financial reporting, tax, and legal implications of structuring complex deals."

It is designed for students that already have a basic familiarity with corporate valuation and DCF analysis (e.g., from corporate finance class or a prior job) as well as solid accounting knowledge. We cover financial analysis of different business models, specific situations (e.g., cyclicals, young growth companies, closely-held firms) as well as the analysis and valuation of foreign companies (e.g., emerging markets, reporting under IFRS). Capital markets have become increasingly global, providing more opportunities for corporate investments and M&A abroad. Evaluating these global investments, however, poses unique challenges for financial analysis (e.g., regarding information, accounting and governance) as well as valuation problems."

      "department": "Booth",
      "description": "The course focuses on the role accounting information plays in facilitating the contracting process. Throughout the quarter, we will discuss contracting issues related to agency and information problems and the role accounting information plays to address these issues. Most classes will begin by discussing a foundational theory paper and will proceed with presentations and discussions of related empirical work. We will begin by covering main ideas from the Positive Accounting Theory. Subsequently, we will spend several weeks on compensation contracts. We will then move to debt contracting issues and will discuss the design of loan contracts with the focus on the use of control rights. We will consider contract design from both the classic agency and the incomplete contracting perspective. Throughout the class will be covering both classic papers and more recent topics. Towards the end of the course, you will present a research project idea in front of the class."

Specifically, the first half of the course will cover accounting choices and consequences by privately held firms. The second half of the course will cover the usefulness of accounting information for stakeholders of the firm that are not equity investors or lenders (non-investor stakeholders), with a focus on suppliers and customers as well as employees. The focus of the course will be to expose students to the existing literature in each of these areas, but we will also discuss the challenges of exploring unregulated transactions and entities, notably accessing data and settings. The course will also contrast the findings in the private-firm space to much larger body of work that uses public firms and investor transactions as a setting. Lastly, we will also discuss the appropriateness of different research designs and statistical methods in this space."

Most courses in the MBA curriculum focus on the market component: they study firms\u2019 interactions with customers, suppliers, and alliance partners in the form of mutually beneficial exchanges transacted in markets. In contrast, this course focuses on the non-market component. For example, businesses need to cope with laws and regulations, lobby for favorable legislation, ensure access to foreign markets, and deal with media coverage and activist pressures, to name just a few. Successful managers need to formulate strategies for their firms that take into account not only the market but also the regulatory, legal, political and social (e.g. non-market) environments in which they operate."

      "description": "This course covers advanced topics in investments from a macro asset allocation perspective. We take the view of a long-term investor, e.g., a global macro hedge fund or a pension fund, seeking to dynamically allocate investments across broad asset classes such as equities, corporate and sovereign bonds, and private equity. Building an asset allocation strategy requires an understanding of the dynamics of risk and return in these asset classes. We will use empirical techniques, including return forecasting regressions, shrinkage estimation, and out-of-sample evaluation methods to shed light on these empirical dynamics. Furthermore, we will see how data from investor surveys and on investor flows can be used to assess the state of investor sentiment. To use the empirical evidence in asset allocation decisions, we will extend the mean-variance portfolio choice framework that you encountered in your introductory investments class to analyze multi-period portfolio policies over long horizons. We will also evaluate practical rule-of-thumb approaches such as risk parity and naive diversification strategies. We will explore in detail the use of leverage, volatility derivatives, and tail-risk hedging; macro risk factors linked to interest rates and monetary policy; inflation risk and inflation-protected bonds; bubbly assets such as crypto currencies or gold. We will discuss the special challenges that investors face in integrating private equity investments, and other similarly illiquid assets, in an asset allocation framework."

Institutional investors, such as pension funds, insurance companies, as well as commercial banks, broker-dealers, and sovereign funds exhibit strong demand for these securities. We first discuss recent trends and the investment opportunities offered by corporate and sovereign bonds, including callable, convertible and other structured securities, their risks and their expected returns. We will then discuss the booming U.S. private credit market, including middle market corporate direct lending, real estate credit, asset-based lending, specialty finance and infrastructure debt; its market participants, and the risk and investment opportunities that it offers to both corporations (who borrow) and investors (who lend). Students will learn to apply factor models and optimization techniques to analyze and construct credit portfolios, as well as asset allocation methods that account for illiquid assets.

In the final set of classes, we put it all together by exploring negotiations that contain elements of both cooperation and competition; that is, these sessions involve cases where the parties can \u201cenlarge the pie\u201d by creating joint gains. Because little in business (or life) gets done without negotiation, this course has the potential to deliver significant upside in your professional and personal outcomes."
