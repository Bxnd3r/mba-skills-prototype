      "description": "Management control focuses on the actions managers take to help ensure that the organization\u2019s objectives and strategies are accomplished, or modified should conditions require it. Increasingly, news stories report control debacles where organizations have suffered large losses, and in some instances, even failure. Each organization must develop its own model for proactively assessing and controlling business risks. This course explores various aspects of the design and evaluation of management control systems. Among the topics discussed are: business risks assessment, beliefs and boundary systems, interactive control systems, diagnostic control systems, open-book management, the balanced (value) scorecard, and performance measures.",

ABC systems also enable managers to focus on efficiently managing activities so that they add value for customers. Other ways that are studied in which cost analysis can help managers include capacity costing, target costing, and relating cost analysis to the theory of constraints. Mr. Peter Turney, a former professor and current CEO of Cost Technologies (an ABC consulting firm), is the instructor for the 1997-98 offering of this course. He is the author of numerous articles and books on ABC.",

      "description": "This course considers significant financial accounting and reporting issues, in the context of the management decisions those issues require. Students will study such classic and contemporary topics as revenue recognition, disclosure of contingencies, the quality of earnings, and the valuation of assets and liabilities \u2013 the very issues being debated daily by Congress, the SEC, auditors and boards of directors everywhere. We will look at the material with a zoom lens, most often retaining a broad focus on the business implications of a financial reporting or accounting issue. Students should see themselves as members of their firm\u2019s executive committee \u2014 people who know the business intimately and who have a legitimate interest in how the results of the business will be reported. Several times during the course we will narrow the focus to look at an accounting issue in detail, so as to explore the process by which accounting standards are established, and how they are implemented. Some of the course looks at the same topics as first year accounting, but more comprehensively. Much of the course addresses topics which were not discussed thoroughly in the first year, such as accounting for foreign operations, pensions, financial instruments and contingencies. This is intended to round out the student\u2019s understanding of the complete picture being communicated by a set of financial statements and the associated disclosures. The course has been designed to give the students a deeper understanding of the issues managements must consider as they confront difficult accounting and reporting questions. The objectives of the course are to help the participants visualize the implications of the decisions they confront, to articulate their objectives for the decision, and to chart a general solution, recognizing the parameters from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which might apply. The course is also intended to provide an introduction to the analysis of financial statements through the study and interpretation of a set of \u201cmystery\u201d financial statements. This exercise is intended to sharpen the student\u2019s ability to assess overall operating performance and financial condition, and to better understand what management is communicating. Grading will be based 40% on class participation, 20% on an in-class paper, and 40% on the results of a final examination. The Fall 2002 \u201cDecisions in Financial Reporting\u201d course will be offered by Professors Allen and Sack. The enclosed course outline is a draft based on the Spring 2002 course. The final course outline will look much like this.",

      "description": "The objective of this course is to help students develop a rich, conceptual understanding of our society\u2019s accounting and financial reporting system.\u00a0 Our discussion will proceed at both an intellectual and a practical level.\u00a0 We will explore contemporary issues (for example, corporate governance, the role of the auditors, mergers and acquisitions, intangible assets, derivatives and stock options) and classic issues (for example, revenue recognition and valuation reserves), working to understand the issue at hand and at the same time to consider the implications of that issue for the numerous constituencies served by the financial reporting system.\u00a0 We will examine the impact that the recent accounting and related business scandals have had on investor confidence and the capital markets, and we will analyze some specific examples of the fraudulent financial reporting that has occurred.\u00a0 Although the primary focus of this course will be on accounting and reporting practices in the United States, we will also address the significant progress that has been made toward establishing international accounting standards. The course is designed for those students who will work with the financial reporting system on a frequent basis, whether as a member of a company\u2019s finance function, as a member of the investment community, as a financially-oriented consultant, or as a business owner.\u00a0 The people responsible for a company\u2019s corporate finance function use the financial reporting system to help communicate the company\u2019s value to its public constituencies.\u00a0 The people in the investment community use the reporting system to help them gather information on investment opportunities and to evaluate their prospects. Some consultants use the reporting system to help their clients see the financial impact of a restructuring or reorganization.\u00a0 Some entrepreneurs use the financial reporting system to help them raise the capital they need for growing their businesses.\u00a0 In each case, the users of the system must understand its purpose and the logic that supports it, the exceptions to that logic that are embedded in the system, and the process by which the system\u2019s standards are established.\u00a0 The development of that understanding is one of the basic objectives of the course.\u00a0 Given that challenging objective, along with the scope and the complexity of the material covered, the course will be both thought-provoking and intense.\u00a0 Students taking the course will be expected to have a good conceptual and working knowledge of the financial accounting content of the first-year ACC course. Students should not sign up for this course and the 15 session elective, Decisions in Financial Reporting.\u00a0 Choose one or the other. FOR WHOM THE COURSE IS INTENDED: Students interested in careers in corporate finance, corporate accounting or treasury, investment banking, commercial banking, public accounting, or management consulting.",

Although students pursuing these career paths do not need tax expertise, they do need to be able to evaluate critically when to call in the tax experts and to understand what the tax experts are saying. This course provides a general survey of the basic tax consequences from fundamental restructuring strategies and a framework for evaluating the priority that taxes have in these strategies. Students will be required to analyze how tax consequences affect the value of different strategies to the buyer and seller. Understanding the effect of taxes on the value of a deal for the buyer and seller prepares future financial executives and strategic advisors for making the right decisions and being effective negotiators. The course focuses on the tax consequences of restructuring strategies and their valuation implications, but it also covers the nontax advantages and disadvantages of these strategies. Most of the course covers the U.S. federal income tax issues of the restructuring of C corporations, but it also will address pass-through entities. Other topics will be taxable asset and stock acquisitions, tax-free asset and stock reorganizations, and divestitures and liquidations.

Students will learn a framework for evaluating the priority that taxes, which directly or indirectly pervade most business transactions, have in business decisions. Students will explore a variety of fundamental business issues such as forming a company, compensating employees, attracting investors, financing projects, and positioning worldwide operations. While the topics deal primarily with U.S. income taxes, the course\u2019s conceptual framework applies irrespective of time and jurisdiction. Students seeking careers in entrepreneurship, management consulting, investment banking, venture capital, or industry, especially general management, corporate finance, or accounting, will find this course of interest.

The focus of the course is on the roles of a company\u2019s accounting system, management and board in creating an environment where managerial decisions lead to high quality stewardship of public disclosure. This course is not about the managerial decisions required by specific generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or about using publicly available accounting information to determine companies\u2019 valuations. After an introduction to the regulatory requirements surrounding corporate disclosures, the course analyzes external communications of financial information through managerial decisions related to earnings guidance, pro-forma earnings, earnings restatements and crises. The course then examines managerial decision-making related to the public disclosure of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. ESG performance spans a range of issues, including company carbon emissions, labor and human rights policies, and corporate governance structures. The course will examine the disclosure of ESG initiatives, the adoption of sustainability accounting standards, and the use of integrated reporting of financial and ESG performance. By the end of this course, students will have a broad understanding of the regulatory landscape and strategic decisions facing executives, directors and regulators regarding the disclosure of financial and nonfinancial performance to the public.",

Students will develop an understanding of screening, forecasting, and valuation tools that aid in the analysis and exploitation of information contained in financial statements. The course includes but is not limited to topics related to the use of ratio analysis, the theory and development of cash-flow and earnings-based valuation models, identification of financial statement management, and the impact of accounting principles and assumptions on valuation. Course content will encompass three modules. The first strengthens students\u2019 understanding of key accounting relations and how detailed ratio analysis can provide a historical perspective on firm activities. An emphasis also is placed on the role of nonfinancial information used as supplements to required accounting reports. The second builds on this foundation with an explicit focus on common valuation and earnings-forecasting techniques that include financial model building using discounted cash flow, multiples, and earnings-based valuation methods. The final module identifies the critical accounting factors that may be unique to the given firm under evaluation. These factors will include identification of and adjustment for off-balance sheet assets and liabilities, multi-national operations, and detecting earnings management. This course should appeal to those planning careers in financial management, consulting, security analysis, investment banking, or credit analysis.",

Since the mid-1980's, however, there has been a dramatic opening up of this potentially dynamic market of more than 90 million consumers (tenth largest country in the world, by population). Mexico has attracted foreign investment and created new business opportunities at a startling rate. As a result of economic, political and social changes (including NAFTA), accessing the Mexican market from the United States has become much easier. But the peso devaluation of December, 1994 and resulting depression have clearly demonstrated the need to better understand the complexities of doing business in Mexico, both in and of itself and as a gateway to the rest of Latin America. The purpose of this course is to enhance students' understanding of the Mexican business environment and the management of firms and business opportunities under these conditions. Designed from a general management perspective, it will touch on all aspects of the business environment, including finance, marketing, operations, people and economics. In addition, issues of cross-cultural management will be studied. This seminar will provide students with the opportunity to learn about Mexico from Mexican academicians, executives, and MBA students. The course will consist primarily of a five workday stay in Mexico City, on a schedule arranged by Darden\u2019s partner school in Mexico, IPADE. (There will also be a weekend, most probably during the middle of the course, for cultural activities.) There will be some background reading and at least one evening introductory session (minimal preparation) prior to the trip (to be held in the late January/early February time frame, to avoid conflict with end-of-Quarter 3 activities). While in Mexico, students will interact intensively with IPADE MBA students in case-discussion classes (and learning teams) conducted at IPADE. Classes will be given by IPADE faculty (most classes will be in English, but some will be in Spanish with simultaneous translation, as a learning experience). There will also be briefings by some of Mexico\u2019s top-performing companies and opportunities to meet and talk with some of Mexico\u2019s leading executives.",

Many of these industries comprise most of what has come to be known as the \u201cnew economy,\u201d and are characterized by structural conditions such as network externalities, poorly defined property rights, heavy investment in \u201cknowledge capital,\u201d rapid innovation, and intense research and development.\u00a0 These conditions have important political, economic, and managerial implications that are redefining the relationships among business, government, and society at large. An important theme of the course will be that managers often have constituencies that extend beyond their customers, competitors, workers, and shareholders, and that they must respond to and manage these interest groups effectively to succeed in the modern economy. This course will examine the implications of these structural characteristics for the competitive process.\u00a0 It will show how emerging technologies, exogenous events, changing societal values, and other environmental forces shape the markets in which we compete, and the institutions that define the nature of competition. It will develop an understanding of market failures due to natural monopolies and information asymmetries, and discuss how regulatory changes have altered the nature of competition in industries characterized by these conditions.\u00a0 A major theme of the course is that these \u201cfailures,\u201d and also attempts to correct them, give rise to significant opportunities.\u00a0 In this regard, the course will show how strategy and tactics can be shaped, not only to react to these changes, but also to alter the evolution of regulatory institutions and practices, and thus gain competitive advantage. Examples of cases to be studied include changes in the nature of reimbursement in the health care industry, such as the move to \u201ccapitated\u201d reimbursement, the move to incentive-based regulations in telecommunications, electricity, and elsewhere, the economics and politics of spectrum auctions in the U.S. and elsewhere, and the impact of environmental policies on competition in the chemical processing industry and elsewhere.",

The course is designed to enable the novice to gain insight into the most salient features of Chinese culture as a local expression of East Asian culture. Course content reflects a view of culture with three distinguishing characteristics: (1) traditional ideas and their attached values; (2) patterns of behavior and action that justify or rationalize those patterns; and (3) institutions that are products of transmitted patterns of behavior and that shape future behavior. Students will be encouraged to analyze these features of culture in terms of their relevance to successful business behavior in China and the East Asian cultural world. A secondary objective of the course is to inspire in course participants a refined international perspective. As they are introduced to the unique features of the culture of China and East Asia, students will be encouraged to think in terms of a world comprising discrete national and cultural traditions, and to consider what that implies for American business interests abroad.",

They generally are versions that the authors have prepared for a non-technical audience but the articles are still rigorous, theoretical and challenging. Third, the discussions and assignments are open ended. Occasionally, we will reach a conclusion but for the most part the implications of the readings and cases will be ambiguous.

They shape our interpersonal interactions with employers, colleagues, partners, and friends, in terms of how we see ourselves, how we present ourselves, and how others receive us.\u00a0 Gender norms shape the stories we tell ourselves about our own work, career, and professional success, as well as the larger narratives we hold about the ability, value, and experience of others.\u00a0 Resulting from the social construct of gender norms, we each possess a sense of who we are as a man, woman, or nonbinary person, and choose how we want to communicate or express our gender identity to others. This course focuses on the ways that gender norms, gender identity, and gender expression affect one\u2019s work, leadership, career, and professional success.\u00a0 We take a multi-disciplinary approach that focuses on the experiences of female-identifying leaders while also acknowledging the limitations posed by gender binaries.\u00a0 In our discussion of gender, we will analyze additional categories and identities such as race, class, ethnicity, and sexuality to better understand women\u2019s and men\u2019s experiences in a gendered workplace. Please note that while this course centers stories about women and narratives regarding gender, all students, regardless of gender identity, can benefit from the course in two ways.\u00a0 First, students will gain greater awareness of the way that gender is embedded in all aspects of work, life, and society.\u00a0 Second, students will learn important tools and skills that are crucial for all emerging leaders.\u00a0 These include: honing your story for professional audiences; navigating the intersections of your identities and professional life; learning effective strategies to advocate for yourself at work and at home; leveraging your network for maximum gain; and aligning your personal values with your actions.

In small group settings and using the case method approach, faculty and staff will challenge participants to make and defend their own battlefield decisions and consider the relevance of these judgments for professional growth and development of a personal leadership style. Participants will also be challenged both on the battlefield and in a final reflective paper to consider what they learned from the experience and how it relates to today\u2019s business culture, business opportunity, and corporate challenges and to reflect personally on the impacts of the program on personal decision making, communication style, and leadership approach.",

      "description": "Course Overview: This is a class teaches and applies sound fundamentals of entrepreneurship for those testing or building a FT venture or side gig. The cadence is two-week sprints alternating customized milestones and common deliverable tools to build your venture. Students in this class will be doing things to build their business. We frequently draw on Effectuation and Village Capital operating systems. No guest speakers or lectures. Guest mentors commonly join to give feedback. These will largely include founders and investors. Classes are Monday 430-615p. Full semester, 3 credits, taught Fall and Spring. Substantial work outside class expected. Beyond teaching this class as an adjunct, I\u2019m an entrepreneur, angel investor, and advisor to startups. I also mentor at TechStars and the iLab and have been an EIR at Wharton and guest mentor at Village Capital. I love early stage and fast-growing startups and the innovative, resourceful, and tenacious founders that drive them. You can easily find my bio CrunchBase or LinkedIn. Syllabus available by request or day #1. Course Objectives: Our mission is to work together to fight through the start-up jungle, navigating around trouble where possible, and fighting through it when foresight fails so you gain applied mastery over skills that will drive your future success as a founder or investor in other ventures regardless how this one fares. If you are putting in the time and effort, I will be generous with my time, ideas, and network to support your venture. If you want to win contests I will support. VV teams tend to do well w 60% of 2018 Ecup finalists, 2017 winner, and 2018 ACC Inventure winners from VV. Some raise money while in class; those with revenue are challenged to grow at least 20%/month; and many are much earlier seeking MVP or PMF which makes it all fun. Elements of Grade: If you care more about your grade than your venture, VV probably is not for you. But if you care about your venture and are coachable your grade will be fine. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Class Contribution: 15%.",

Expert entrepreneurs are people who have built multiple ventures including successes and failures and taken at least one company public.

The course materials synthesize these lessons for the classroom while also drawing upon the histories of hundreds of ventures including for-profit, nonprofit, and everything in between. Students will not only learn the five principles of effectual entrepreneurship but also learn to apply these to a variety of situations including different stages of starting and growing a new venture, turning around, growing and leading existing ventures, and solving large problems in the world.

The course addresses, in broad terms, both entrepreneurs and their environments. You will find this course most valuable if you think you might some day like to start or acquire a firm of your own or can picture yourself working in a highly entrepreneurial firm, large or small. It should also prove beneficial for those seeking positions in venture capital or service firms investing in or assisting entrepreneurial firms. The course cannot make you an entrepreneur, but a major goal is to increase significantly your probability of success in entrepreneurial pursuits. The course explores several fundamental questions: (1) what is entrepreneurship and what is the significance of entrepreneurship in the economy? (2) who and what are \"entrepreneurs\"? (3) how do you find and identify \"good\" opportunities? (4) what alternative venturing formats and entry strategies exist in/for pursuing entrepreneurial paths?

Course Objectives: Specific course objectives include: (1) demystifying the entrepreneurial process through analyses of various entrepreneurial situations and individuals; (2) communicating and supporting attitudes, knowledge, frameworks, theories, and skills associated with successful entrepreneurial activity; (3) providing an opportunity for participants to evaluate their own interests in, and potential for, an entrepreneurial path; and (4) becoming familiar with the sources and processes of raising early capital.",

On the first day of the course, we will discuss how we\u2019ll spend our time together and describe course expectations. Readings and cases will provide a basis for the remainder of the week\u2019s discussions on entrepreneurship and regional growth. Each following day of our program takes a focus on the challenge for entrepreneurs operating in industries or markets that have prominence in the Washington metropolitan area: Telecommunications, Media, Defense, Security, Biotechnology and Healthcare. These industries draw on the traditional strengths of the region, and the intersection of technology, capital providers, governments and nonprofits, and the community of entrepreneurs. We will also hear the personal stories of entrepreneurs that have decided to share their skills and resources in philanthropic activity. Each day\u2019s work will generally begin with an orienting class session, followed by field visits, panels, or guest lectures. Given this course\u2019s reliance on the participation of practicing entrepreneurs, the format may change with each day to accommodate their scheduling needs.

It is aimed at attracting a group of interested students who believe they will be likely to have banking or consulting clients in the Life Sciences industry or who aspire to take a role in the creation of new enterprises in this sector. In this industry, whether Biotech or Devices, the consumer of products, the patient, does not choose the product, pay for it, or have any say about what products are available. This is a unique environment in which anyone involved needs to have a working knowledge of the philosophy, terminology, and processes their clients, companies, or products will have to follow. The course is not designed to make students regulatory experts but to show them ways to navigate the regulatory pathways and related issues, which impact every phase of the creation and growth of a Life Sciences company. For the most part, students will not examine the issues surrounding the growth of provider or service businesses such as hospitals but instead explore the issues related to businesses built around proprietary technology.

      "description": "While every year technology improvements make it cheaper and easier to build more powerful software, creating winning products and offerings is tougher than ever. By one measure, 64% of features are rarely or never used, 50-70% of IT projects fail, and 90% of new products are flop. That\u2019s a lot of waste, expense, and missed opportunity. Where does this problem originate and who should solve it? Hint: it\u2019s not with the software developers, testers, or administrators. If you guessed \u2018the businessperson\u2019, you\u2019re absolutely right. Few skills are as highly demanded in the marketplace as the ability to identify user needs and translate those into digital solutions. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn in Software Design. While you may never be a software designer in title, it is highly likely that you\u2019ll need the ability to think like a software designer and collaborate with development teams. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll be proficient in today\u2019s most prevalent applied innovation methods, including: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Discovering and validating your early market and focal customer problems through subject interviews \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Formulating testable propositions and design experiments to rapidly test them (a la Lean Startup) \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Creating development-friendly, collaboration-friendly inputs through user stories and prototypes \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parallel prototyping and testing user interface concepts",

We will use the class to further develop entrepreneurial fundamentals like partnering, customer sales, and managing your affordable loss. The cadence is two-week sprints alternating customized milestones and work on deliverables common to the class which will contribute directly to your venture. We draw extensively on Saras Sarasvathy\u2019 s Effectuation theory methodology to guide action and ensure that progress doesn\u2019t stall even if the end point is a decision to move on from the venture at the end of the class. No guest speakers or lectures. Guest mentors commonly join to give feedback. These will largely include founders and investors. Classes are Full semester, 3 credits, taught Fall and Spring. Substantial work outside class expected. This class was originally created by Damon DeVito who was both an adjunct faculty and a long-time entrepreneur.\u00a0 Most importantly, he believed in founders and that emphasis will continue. Academic Course Objectives (35 to 70 words in bullet-point format and phrases): Our mission is to work together to fight through the start-up jungle, navigating around trouble where possible, and fighting through it when foresight fails so you gain applied mastery over skills that will drive your future success as a founder or investor in other ventures regardless how this one fares.

      "description": "Innovation and Technology are considered in this course from a strategic perspective and are viewed as playing an essential role in the development and achievement of long-term competitive advantage. The course covers technology strategy and the innovation process for new products or services. There are three modules: Module One: Creating and Realizing ValueInnovation is invention that creates value. Why do some inventions not create value? When innovation occurs, what conditions and attributes affect who realizes the value? Why does an innovating firm sometimes not realize the value it creates? What insights do these observations suggest about managing the innovation process? Module Two: Prioritizing OpportunitiesProjects that involve the innovation process are notoriously difficult to value. Some say that if you use NPV, it would be more efficient to torch the R&D facility. How should you set priorities when choosing among innovation opportunities? If you use \"options thinking\" to develop insights, how do you use it? What insight does options thinking suggest for managing the dynamic innovation process? Under what conditions should you stop a project? How do the options thinking insights fit with \"stage and gate\" management of R&D? Module Three: Managing the Innovation ProcessInnovation is not an event, but a dynamic journey. Managing the process requires thinking about the unfolding (and often non-linear) stages and about multiple dimensions that cumulate in success (or failure). Most importantly, the process and its outcomes depend on the people. How do you guide early stage research efforts toward (possibly distant) products? How do you think about the many uncertainties and manage the risks? How do you avoid running out of cash? How do you deal with the changes of course, challenges of competition, setbacks and forward leaps in managing big, long-term innovation efforts? This course deals with both small and large corporations and encompasses a wide range of technologies such as medical devices, biotechnology, optical fiber and software. It is not a course on information technology. The course schedule of cases, speakers and topics used in 2000 can be found on my website: http://faculty.darden.edu/TeisbergE/.",

      "description": "The United States and many other countries face a trio of inequalities: income, wealth, and opportunity. While income inequality is a well-accepted result of a capitalist economy, the degree of inequality has been steadily increasing since 1979. Many including Nobel Prize winning economists Robert Schiller and Joseph Stiglitz state that economic inequality is the defining challenge of our time. There is substantial evidence that technological innovation may increase the level of economic inequality even more in the near future. Some believe this may threaten capitalism and democracy. This course will explore economic inequality, social mobility, and their relationship from different points of view. Assignments are often researched during workshops and involve PowerPoint slides answering specific questions. There will be an individual written paper in the form of an essay or blog-like document that addresses some issue related to the topic of the course.",

The course uses Socratic method to explore fictional novels and short stories as texts. Fiction affects us emotionally and allows us to see particularity and complexity within universally recognizable situations. Characters are multifaceted, and plots are multi-layered, which provides fertile ground for discussion.

The elective is based on a pioneering new approach- using pre-scripting and rehearsal-to prepare business managers/leaders for values-driven decision-making and action.Rather than simply talking about these difficult decisions and conversations, you will have the opportunity to practice them. The approach called \"Giving Voice To Values\" (GW) has been used in over 1,035 pilots at schools and organizations on seven continents and has been featured in McKinsey Quarterly; Harvard Business Review (twice); Financial Times; Stanford Social Innovation Review; BusinessWeek; Washington Post; Huffington Post; etc. Leading corporations like Lockheed Martin, Prudential and Unilever, among others, have used or are exploring pilots of the approach.Drawing on both the actual experience of business practitioners as well as cutting edge research,GW fills a long-standi ng and critical gap in our understanding of how to enable emerging leaders to effectively enact their values. Rather than a focus on ethical analysis,GVV focuses on ethical action and asks the question: \"What if Iwere going to act on my values? What would Isay and do? How could Ibe most effective?\"",

What are the challenges and opportunities that go along with doing business in developing economies? How do you build a value proposition for your product and make sense of cross-cultural differences in the perceptions of products? How do you determine which countries/markets are a good match for your value proposition? How do you build shareholder value globally?

      "description": "This corporate-finance course focuses on corporate policy and the tactics that increase the value of the corporation. The course starts by stressing how managers interface with the capital markets to learn the return required by the firm\u2019s different investors. This required return, or cost of capital, is used later as the key variable to assess whether capital-investment proposals can create value for stakeholders. This illustrates the process of the manager\u2019s relying on the informational efficiency of the capital markets to communicate the minimum return on investment that can create value within the firm. Students explore a two-stage process for the optimal capital-structure decision, where managers must first project future funding needs for the company, after which they can turn their attention to creating the optimal mix of debt and equity to fund those needs and enhance shareholders\u2019 wealth. Students are shown how investment and financing policies can interact by overlaying large investment decisions (mergers and acquisitions) with the decision of how to finance the transaction.",
