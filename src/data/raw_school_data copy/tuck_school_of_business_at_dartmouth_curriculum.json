Second, the application effort, properly guided, helps sharpen students\u2019 understanding of the components of deliberate practice and the relationships among them. Third and most importantly, it helps students deepen their internalization of the modus operandi associated with deliberate practice, ideally to the point where it becomes second nature in guiding their pursuit of excellence going forward."

      "department": "LOB",
      "description": "Exceeding performance expectations is not enough in today's business climate if an executive is to succeed. Executives must find ways for developing their employees in order to get the very best productivity. Wise leaders recognize that people are a source of corporate wealth. A potent leader co-creates with his or her people to push the company ahead of the competition. But before a leader can assume this role and responsibility, they must be willing to engage in their own developmental journey. In this course, we take leadership out of the box by studying the lives of extraordinary leaders while engaging in our own self-exploration. Our intent is to appreciate the strengths and frailties all leaders possess, and to understand the learning edges we all experience. This course creates the space to study, reflect on and discuss principles of leadership, such as self-awareness, identity, faith, vision, courage, passion, mindfulness, and commitment. By studying the lives of others, we learn how the context shapes the experiences and choices of leaders over the course of their lives. We also recognize the power of the historical moment that enables certain men and women to come to the forefront at critical times."

Perhaps most prominent among these anxieties is the fading belief among many people in many countries in the dynamic forces of globalization and innovation. Much of this ambivalence and related anxiety stems from workers and their families not seeing sufficient growth in their income, wealth, and sense of opportunity: sufficient relative to earlier decades, relative to those at the top, and relative to their hopes and expectations. We live in a time where many nations are fractious and less trusting, with far less consensus about the proper balance among for-profit businesses, sovereign governments, and civil society."

In the first half of the course, students will develop an understanding of the barriers to DEI, such as systems of inequality, denial of privilege, biases that hinder support for DEI, and the many biases facing marginalized groups. Through lectures, in-class role-play exercises, and case discussions, students will also learn about how organizational characteristics (e.g., power and status hierarchies, workplace cultures) impact the efficacy of DEI interventions. In the second half of the course, students will learn how to improve organizational DEI at the individual level (e.g., addressing bias, recruiting allies, creating psychological safety, advocating for oneself in the face of bias) and at the organizational level (e.g., hiring practices and workplace policies that measurably improve DEI). By the end of this course, students will be adept at identifying and addressing sources of inequity, having difficult conversations, mitigating problems associated with stereotypes, and managing diverse, equitable, and inclusive environments. Importantly, this class teaches students how to advocate for DEI issues in organizational settings, equipping them with the necessary research, persuasion tactics, and analytical skills needed to be advocates, even in the face of resistance."

      "description": "The distribution channel is the route through which suppliers\u2019 products reach end-customers. Channel members provide many essential services to end-customers without which the supplier would fail, and which the supplier often cannot efficiently provide itself.  But, channel members are customers in their own right, with their own needs.  Further, they usually market not only the supplier\u2019s products but also competitors\u2019 products and their own private label products.  Their motivations and objectives are typically not aligned with those of the supplier, hence the challenge of \u201ccoordinating the channel\u201d.  Managing the distribution channel or route-to-market was never easy but it has never been more challenging than it is today. At the same time as suppliers of products ranging from packaged goods and sporting goods to hotels and cars are bypassing retailers to go directly to end customers, other middlemen are inserting themselves to perform narrow functions and take slices from an-often shrinking profit pie."

Areas that we will study that are using NLP include merger prediction and performance, profitability prediction, stock return prediction, evaluation of venture capital business plans, innovation and patenting, banking and other finance topics.  Our study materials will be academic articles in finance and economics, not computer science.  Students will be responsible for reading and presenting the materials in these articles as well as doing a final research project that would involve analysis of textual data using some of the methods covered in this course.   There will be active learning in this course as students will help lead the discussion of various topic areas and we will have some Python exercises that have been developed with accompanying videos.

But the qualities that make wine valuable culturally and those that make it a valuable asset are rarely the same. More than this, they are often in contradiction: wine\u2019s scarcity, longevity, and brand equity are often seen as the three key strategic drivers of financial performance, yet it is the ephemerality, variability, and conviviality derived from its consumption that make wine culturally compelling. This Sprint will examine what accounts for this unique product's deep cultural significance in communities around the world against the means by which it is appraised commercially, and interrogate how those two systems intersect in an effort to identify the contours of an asset class whose performance is profoundly influenced by the intangible."

And while these topics are critically important,  a lot of your success in careers and life is actually driven by other things. Over the past decade or so, there has been an explosion in understanding these success factors and this Sprint is an MBA oriented version of a highly successful course being taught at the Harvard Kennedy School. The Sprint is structured into three themes: knowing yourself and what drives wellbeing (e.g., aspirations, motivations, values, purpose, happiness, grit, role of money); where are you going and how are you getting there (e.g., career satisfaction, career optionality, working across boundaries, networks, sponsorship); and building resilience (e.g., wellness, stress, mental health, work and family.)  Because of the shortness of this Sprint, we mostly focus on the science and academics around these themes. Having said that, the course has a practical bent, and some self-reflection is required. Plus, students will be asked to experiment with some form of a wellbeing exercise."

      "description": "Within this structure, we will focus on both the internal (i.e., psychological) and external (i.e., social, cultural, environmental, situational) factors that influence consumer behavior and will examine consumer behavior insights generated by behavioral economics, cognitive science and social psychology. By using consumer psychology as a foundation and increasing familiarity with analytical and research tools used by marketers, students in this course will be able to predict what consumers might be expected to do versus what they will do in a variety of marketing settings. This course will involve a combination of case discussions, in-class exercises and assignments that will move students beyond using personal intuition about consumer behavior and equip them with concepts and tools to uncover, interpret, and apply consumer insights to drive strategic decision-making."

How these technologies can \u2013 and should \u2013 be used for strategic value-generating purposes, however, is not straightforward. This course grapples with this challenge, with the primary aim being to help students understand how to unlock the value in digital/social platforms across a variety of business contexts and for several markedly different marketing-related purposes. Thus, students should leave the course knowing the basics of digital marketing jargon and with the underlying knowledge to become proficient in digital marketing. Within this course, students will learn how to developing appropriate digital marketing strategies, additionally understanding the tools necessary to analyze and guide strategy (e.g., current and future AI). An ancillary goal of this course is to gain practical experience in fielding digital marketing campaigns."

They are multifaceted, long term and deeply rooted in history, requiring systemic, multi-pronged, and interdisciplinary approaches to address effectively. I chose the word 'wicked' to describe this course because it reflects the harm these issues inflict on society and highlights their morally troubling nature. Wicked problems share several commonalities.  First, there is an interconnectedness between these problems -- they do not stand alone.  These issues cross borders, ethnicities, races, genders, historical periods, and organizational boundaries, thus impacting the well-being of humankind.  Second, there are no easy fixes for resolving wicked problems.  Such problems act as chameleons changing and evolving over time, taking on new characteristics while creating deeper obstacles. Indeed, when it comes to wicked problems, change is a slow and drawn-out process."
